The High Court hearing of the criminal case against former managing director of listed financial services group Tigon, Gary Porritt (54) and his associate Sue Bennett (56), kicked off with Judge Brian Spilg reprimanding Porritt, but thereafter continued at a snail s pace.Shortly after 10am on Wednesday, the third day of the trial, Spilg made a ruling regarding the admission of certain documents.Porritt &#8211; who is unrepresented and has been raising his hand regularly over the previous two days to indicate to prosecutor Advocate Etienne Coetzee and first witness Jack Milne to slow down, as he painstakingly makes notes of everything said in court &#8211; tried to stop Spilg. Please do not stop me, Spilg told Porritt. Porritt complained that he needed an opportunity to write this down and said he has a problem in that he cannot read or write fast. Spilg explained to him that he was making a ruling and Porritt need not write everything down. He won t be prejudiced, Spilg said. He advised him to rely on his co-accused Bennett who apparently makes notes on her computer and has not complained of falling behind.When Spilg continued, Porritt raised his hand as he does to slow down Coetzee and Milne. Be sure that you do not raise your hand to me when I m speaking,&#8221; Spilg said and repeated that Porritt was not being prejudiced.As Porritt tried to get up to respond, Spilg said: Sit down, Mr Porrit. I m speaking.&#8221;When Coetzee later during the proceedings also tried to assert himself against Porritt slowing him down, Spilg reprimanded Coetzee, saying That is for me, not for you. He explained repeatedly that Porritt, not being represented, should be given an opportunity to make notes of what is being said in court as well as thoughts he might have about questions to put to the witness later during cross-examination.After the lunch adjournment, Porritt apologised to Spilg for the earlier skirmish, saying he meant no disrespect and he feels bad that he writes so slowly. Spilg responded that it is something that must be taken into account and that the accused should not be prejudiced.The day was mostly spent by the prosecution submitting documents to the court, some of them authored by Milne and others from the business records of Tigon.Most of these documents date back to early 2000 and were drafted in preparation of the establishment of PSC Guaranteed Growth Limited (PSCGG), the asset management company underwritten by Tigon.PSCGG collapsed in 2002 when Tigon failed to honour its guarantee and almost 3 000 investors lost around R162 million in the process.Milne had earlier pleaded guilty on several charges relating to these events and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, three of which were suspended. He was released after serving 11 months of the sentence.His plea at the time included an agreement with the State to testify against Porritt, which is what is currently transpiring in this hearing before the South Gauteng High Court. Porritt and Bennett are facing more than 3 000 charges, including fraud and the transgression of several financial Acts.A document sent by Milne to Porritt on April 14 2000 was also admitted as evidence. In it Milne made several suggestions about the contents of the PSCGG prospectus. This included statements that Milne would be solely responsible for the management of the capital and that specific reference would be made to his teachings about how to manage a stock portfolio. He further suggested that the prospectus states that the fund would outperform unit trusts and any performance below unit trusts would be guaranteed by Tigon.That would mean that investors would always achieve at least the same results as the unit trust industry.Milne further suggested that the prospectus states Tigon would get 50% of the performance above that of the unit trust industry (after costs) in return for its guarantee.He further stated the directors of PSCGG to be himself as MD, Bennett as executive director, Jim Milne as non-executive and Tony Hodgkinson as financial director.A subsequent document admitted in on Wednesday shows changes made by Porritt on the Jack Milne document. He changed it to state that Milne will lead the investment team and changed a reference to the ability of Jack Milne to achieve superior investment returns as proven in the earlier Heystek competition to the Jack Milne approach .Porritt further changed the entity that would take responsibility for the administration of the fund and be paid for it from Milne s Progressive Systems College (PSC) to Tigon.Some of the charges against the accused include that they, together with Milne and other individuals, made false statements in the PSCGG prospectus and did so falsely and deliberately to deceive the public.This included that Milne would control the funds raised and manage them using the method taught by PSC and followed by Milne in the competition.The State alleges that the accused had no intention of honouring the guarantee to PSCGG and created the false impression that the worst investment performance the investment fund could deliver would be equal to that of domestic unit trusts. This impression was created to encourage members of the public to invest in PSCGG, the State alleges.Court adjourned until Thursday and Porritt and Bennett s bail was extended accordingly.
