Judges Brian Spilg and Lebogang Modiba, sitting as an appeal court bench in the Johannesburg High Court, recently handed down a judgment relating to the failure of a company to pay to VAT and PAYE over to the South African Revenue Services (Sars).Grayston Technology Investment (GTI) and its sole shareholder and director, Bernardus Hermanus Pieters, were earlier convicted in the Regional Court (RC) of the common law crime of theft for not paying these taxes over to Sars.Pieters was the public officer of GTI and was therefore personally liable for Grayston s tax liability in the event that it failed or was unable to pay.According to the judgment both appellants were charged with common law theft of both VAT monies amounting to R946 038.92 (30 counts) and PAYE monies totalling R844 554.32 (63 counts), with alternative counts of contravening various provisions of the VAT Act and the Fourth Schedule of the Income Tax Act respectively (counts 67 to 96 and 97 to 160). At issue was what constituted criminal theft in respect of monies. The RC convicted the accused of theft, on the basis that the money never belonged to them but to Sars. The RC s judgment suggested that the accused were, in a sense, trustees and the money belonged to Sars and that they had a fiduciary duty to account to it.The accused denied in the RC and on appeal that a fiduciary relationship existed between it and Sars and that neither of the accused evinced an intention to commit theft. The Supreme Court of Appeal had previously ruled in an unrelated matter that the VAT Act does not create a fiduciary relationship but one of debtor and creditor.What counted in the accused s favour is that there was no suggestion that Grayston had failed to properly account to Sars in respect of VAT and PAYE, but that Grayston had failed to pay the money over to Sars.The court held that there was a statutory limitation on criminal liability in relation to PAYE offences and that the Constitution safeguards against double jeopardy. The administrative penalties that Sars could impose meant that one could not be convicted thereafter in a criminal court on the same facts.Judges Spilg and Modiba set aside the RC s theft conviction and convicted Grayston and Pieters of a contravention of the VAT Act and the Income Tax Act.Pieters was sentenced to three years, suspended for a period of three years on condition that he is not convicted on VAT and income tax offences during this period.An interesting corollary to this appeal judgment is the question whether, if one could demonstrate a special interest in money that is in a thief s account, whether one could be a preferment creditor?
