NASTASSIA ARENDSE: The tourism industry continues to play an important role in the South African economy and according to South Africa s Tourism Minister Derek Hannekom, the sector is showing a remarkable bounce back with international arrivals up 15.4% in the first six months of this year compared to last year. Now to talk to us about the industry in Gauteng is Siphiwe Ngwenya, he s the CEO of the Gauteng Tourism Authority.Siphiwe thank you so much for your time.SIPHIWE NGWENYA: Thank you and good afternoon.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Let s start off by outlining what are some of the objectives of the Gauteng Tourism Authority, what have you been mandated to do?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: The Gauteng Tourism Authority is currently purely a destination marketing agency. Our role is to brand and promote Gauteng and to showcase the different signature attractions and the experiences around Gauteng. We are therefore a league promoting agency of the Gauteng offerings.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: And in your assessment and I know you were appointed CEO earlier this year, in your assessment of Gauteng s tourism sector how is it performing thus far?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: The tourism sector continues to perform much better than the other sectors that have been identified by the South African government in terms of the NDP and as you will note that tourism lately has surpassed most of the sectors that government has put a focus on. We are growing by some 11% in the first quarter and have continued to do so but on the provincial level, in terms of Gauteng, we have seen the share of arrivals into the province increasing from 38.9% of 2014 to a 41.1% in terms of 2015.We have also seen the tourism spend increasing to between R29.6bn and key is that the total bed nights has also increased. But overall the key issue has been the average length of stay into Gauteng has increased from 7.5 days to 8.2 days which then increases the contribution in terms of the spend by people into restaurants, sight-seeing and so forth. So generally there has been a tremendous appetite in terms of the offerings around Gauteng GP Lifestyle and township tourism as well as the business offerings around Sandton or Johannesburg in particular.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Speaking of areas such as Sandton where people come to shop and eat, what is the Tourism Authority doing in terms of driving all of those tourists, once you ve done shopping and eating, where you go into some townships like Mamelodi and Daveyton, where you get to see the classic cars etcetera, what are you guys doing in terms of driving that traffic into the township and promoting the township tourism there?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: As you know Gauteng has a programme that the food for the five years which is a transformation to modernising and revitalising and also for that is the township enterprise revitalisation, so township programme is a very key and important element and what we really do is we have mobilised a lot of township enterprises and we have assisted them in terms of putting them onto our database and marketing their offering so that people can do beyond just going to Vilakazi Street.And people coming into Sandton now, we have linked them up with the big two operators so that they don t just see townships as a by the way additional thing to do. But just before they even arrive into Gauteng we have made sure that people who sell destinations and different international platforms, the brics countries feed our traditional markets of Europe and America, they package the township programme for people to go there.And the offerings of the big as you have indicated at least the popular townships are Mamelodi, working with the municipalities in there, we have identified cases such as the Solomon Mahlangu area. We have been showing people the areas around the Dr Ruberu and people have dedicated certain trips to take people to the history of the townships, in the east and the Vaal area. There ve also been people taking them to the pass laws march route that has been happening around the Vaal area as well as showcasing people the routes in Soweto, because we ve got plenty of guides and specialists around that area who take people around to show them around. And we found that most of the European and American tourists really like to see those kinds of things. The combination of what they ve traditionally been picking up in the papers around what townships can offer.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Siphiwe I can imagine that you engage on a regular basis with a lot of the SMMEs operating in township economies and those particularly that specialise in tourism. From what they tell you and the feedback on the ground, what are some of the challenges that they are faced with?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: Well one of the key issues that face the townships for them to be able to access people outside South Africa, international guests and two have been the issues of grading and accreditation of their facilities. Thirdly also has been an issue where they needed to be introduced into understanding what does a German traveller really like and when they arrive, how can you be able to give them things that they can like.So what we have done is basically we have also looked into areas where we can introduce [?] to understand the language and to understand the customers that they are serving. But also the SMME challenge has been issues where they would need the municipalities to assist them in offering security around the precinct where the tourists come and also to assist them with different compliance issues so that they can be able to have offerings beyond just food, such as legal licensing, some of them also looking into how they can negotiate some of the by-laws to make sure that the neighbours can accommodate them operating as an SMME in a residential area.The common views of course of access to finance for them to expand is also one of the elements but as the Gauteng Tourism Authority we have taken a lot of time to take their issues in terms of marketing and introducing them to buyers. This year we took over 30 SMMEs to the Indaba in Durban and most people were able to showcase their places in Durban there at the Indaba where international buyers were coming through. So accessing those kinds of exhibitions is also one of the limitations that they ve never had.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: I can imagine that the term collaboration which I know has been used quite extensively when you get to events such as Meetings Africa, how is collaboration going between you and other cities within South Africa?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: We do a lot of collaboration among ourselves. As you know that there is an Africa WTO (World Trade Organisation) component which brings together different places and so far that Africa WTO is represented by Gauteng, Western Cape as well as some people from Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Now most of the collaboration that we re looking at is that we need to sell South Africa as a complete country. The offerings that are there in Cape Town and Durban which are not here in Gauteng, such as your mountains and the sea is not something that should be sold in exclusion of what Gauteng can offer.So our collaboration is clearly saying that people arrive through Johannesburg at the OR Tambo Airport, while they are here we look into how we package their stay over the country saying that those who would like to see related issues and then be able to move into Durban. Those that would like to do a much extensive, big five beyond what Gauteng can offer, we collaborate with Mpumalanga and Limpopo. So much of our collaboration is such that we package our programmes in such a way that for a traveller or a visitor they can travel through the visitor economy in a continuous way that they don t see it as a separated state like they have in their own countries.But for us it s a matter of how one can travel through without needing another passport when traveling to another province. We are one country and our collaboration is therefore done through marketing. Meetings Africa as you mentioned is one of the examples where other provinces come here. Indaba is one where we go and collaborate in terms of other offerings of other provinces and as Gauteng we have entered into some MOUs (Memorandum of Understanding) between North West and we are currently about to finalise one with Limpopo because people come and want to go to Sun City and come back into Gauteng so that they can continue with issues that we offer here which is mainly lifestyle like eating places, places such as Maboneng and so forth.So there are collaborations that we do just beyond the provinces but collaboration with the businesses as well. That different business people to be able to say the tour guide of Gauteng can collaborate with the tour guide of North West, also Mpumalanga because they will then be able to hand over a good offering that they have done. Because the first point of contact is what lasts with the visitor.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Siphiwe I know you ve got an extensive CV and experience, and for those who don t know, prior to you joining the Gauteng Tourism Authority you were with the Gauteng Growth and Development Agency, and I do understand that you ve got a wealth of experience when it comes to strategic management capabilities. Now while we were talking about collaboration and acting as a country working together, how do you think we can best position ourselves, perhaps even Gauteng better as an attractive investment brand?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: Well Gauteng has got a lot to offer in terms of investment and attraction for people to invest in Gauteng. First and foremost Gauteng operates as a global city region which is what the Premier is pioneering the programmes of the provincial government and the municipalities are similar in terms of dealing with what needs to be offered for investors that come through into Gauteng. That includes issues that have got to do with local government offerings and also the programmes have insured that do incentive offerings which are not necessarily monetary incentives as compared to what the DTI is offering but incentives such as the one stop shop facilities that has been set in Sandton which facilitates that people can do their visa registration while them to set up a business and we have also positioned ourselves so that we do deal with issues of land availability as well as services in Gauteng.So our positioning of Gauteng is that we do offer places of doing business such as the special economic zone which is available and has a lot of package incentives in it and we do offer as well connectivity with the different compliance institutions at a one stop shop, and we also do offerings for people who want to do business in Gauteng with different chambers of commerce that they can access. But also we are a centre of financial institutions which are around here, almost most of the global institutions that you can find are here that are related to financial matters, can be accessed.But we are also a well-positioned entry point into the African continent because a number of international companies that operate in most African countries are based here in Gauteng. And they are also invested in different countries. So if you want to have a perspective in terms of the risk factors, legal factors, the financial matters and so forth of other African countries, you are able to step onto success stories of countries that are on the doorstep here in Gauteng. So we are a holistic centre for a business person who really wants to tap into the growing market of Africa.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Going forward, perhaps even for the rest of the year or what will be your key focus?SIPHIWE NGWENYA: Well our key focus as Gauteng Tourism is basically to increase the footfall in Gauteng and we also want to expand Gauteng offerings to different regions that we have not rigorously tapped into areas such as the Middle East. We also want to increase our role in our traditional source market such as generally the UK and America which accounts for the highest numbers of international arrivals into Gauteng.But we are also wanting to do more promotional drives on lifestyle and entertainment events that are in Gauteng as well as promotion of our signature event. Just to mention one other thing that we have established through the Premier and the MEC for Economic Development Building Fund to bring in more and bigger events because here in Gauteng, we do have more than any other place in South Africa, where we can host a bigger conferences and make available some of them.This morning I had a very interesting chat with the investment that has been done around the racing track of Kyalami which now has one of the biggest convention centres there that they have built and that is a world class facility. And the confidence that has been shown by Porsche Property of an investment of over R500m shows that they have done their projections that there is a need for more facilities in investment into property. But in investment and events related facilities, we will be anchoring our approach in growing Gauteng and the brand Gauteng to show people that this is a place where events would be well catered for with the infrastructure that we have.But also would like to encourage more tourists into the townships because now townships have transformed from just being the mattress of residential and people as was defined pre-1994 to now being a centre of business activities. So there are a whole range of experiences that people can know about South Africa and the people of South Africa and the people of Gauteng in particular and there will be a lot of experiences that they can be taken to, be it historical houses, be it entertainment places, be it in terms of different music offerings that we have in Gauteng.I might also indicate that we will be looking into the expansion of the red bus into some of the areas such as Sandton, Rosebank, to make sure that we can showcase the new city development beyond Johannesburg and we ll be looking also into areas of the other cities, such as Tshwane where we can roll out more of the operations such as the red bus. So those are some of the issues that we will be working on in terms of increasing our city sightseeing, the township operations, but above all, our jewel is the Cradle of Humankind which is in Maropeng with an investment that was done by the Gauteng province around the Sterkfontein caves and those areas but we do need to increase awareness of the Cradle of Humankind [unclear] in particular because it has now been proven from those who follow anthropology, tourism that the origin of humankind is from here in Gauteng, and that people can know better about the origin of man and also link their history with Africa.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Siphiwe you have so many exciting activities lined up, I m already excited and considering the fact that I do enjoy going onto the red bus and I do look forward to seeing more of those buses across Gauteng. Thank you so much for your time.SIPHIWE NGWENYA: Thank you and being Woman s Month I would like to say that we are rolling out a lot of programmes that we have rolled out already and we will be focusing on elderly women where we have a programme of Ama Gogo taking them to different places in the townships as well as to the Cradle of Humankind for them to move away from being people that are looked at as where we should dump our children and so forth. But because they are organised by putting money into things like stokvels and so forth we are really tapping into a collaboration with them that they need to criss-cross their own country and get to know it.So among the Women s programme that will begin this month is that of the elderly women where we will be taking 10 of Ama Gogo around Gauteng to make sure that they also could know some of the places beyond where they have been confined for most of their lives.
