South Africa’s trade balance swung to a deficit in August after three months of surpluses as the shipment of precious metals and stones, which include gold and diamonds, slumped. The R8.6 billion ($619 million) deficit compares with as a revised surplus of R5 billion in July, the Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. The median of ten economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a surplus of R1.6 billion. South Africa recorded its first quarterly trade surplus in a year in the three months through June as mining exports surged, helping to narrow the deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of goods and services, to 3.1% of gross domestic product from 5.3%. While the rand could benefit from the smaller current-account shortfall, the currency’s 11% gain against the dollar this year could reduce demand for South African products abroad at a time when a weak global economy, low commodity prices and a drought are weighing on output. “The export growth momentum experienced by South Africa is at risk of not being sustained in the coming quarters,” Kamilla Kaplan, an economist at Investec, said in an e-mailed note to clients before the release of the data. “Global trade growth is expected to be particularly weak this year.” The cumulative surplus for the first eight months of 2016 is R7.4 billion compared with a shortfall of R35.1 billion in the same period last year. Exports decreased by 5.5% to R90.2 billion as the shipments of precious metals and stones fell by 30% and vehicles and transport equipment declined by 10%. Imports rose by 9.2% to R98.8 billion as the purchases of mineral products, which include oil, increased by 24%. The currency weakened 0.1% to 13.9073 per dollar as on 2:15pm in Johannesburg. Monthly trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds. © 2016 Bloomberg
