CAPE TOWN The PlexCrown ratings published every quarter provide a useful measure of the recent relative performance of fund management companies and their unit trust offerings. What they also do is highlight which unit trust categories have been the best and worst performers over certain time periods.As these are category averages, they only give a very broad picture. A serious outlier in terms of either outperformance or underperformance could have a meaningful impact on the numbers.However, they nevertheless provide an interesting insight into where investors have been able to achieve good returns, and where performance has been less than stellar.For the 12 months to June 2016 these were the best and worst category returns:Unit trust category performance to June 30 2016Category1 year returnBest&nbsp;Worldwide equity &#8211; unclassified89.41%Global real estate general30.26%Global interest bearing variable term26.47%Global multi-asset income23.38%Global multi-asset low equity20.01%Worst&nbsp;South African equity general1.46%South African equity large cap1.36%Regional equity general0.60%Global equity unclassified-1.67%South African equity financial-8.61%Source: PlexCrown Survey Q2 2016There is only a single fund in the worldwide equity unclassified category, so its place at the top of the table is largely negligible. It is a gold fund, which explains its remarkable outperformance in the short term.The exchange rate has played a big role in the performance of the other categories at the top of the table. This was a period in which the rand fell from R12.26 against the dollar to R14.74, so dollar assets appreciated nearly 20% in rand terms before any other gains. The returns from global real estate funds were however particularly good.On the downside, most of the worst performers were local equity options, reflecting the muted returns on the JSE. Financial sector funds were particularly hard hit in this period that included Nenegate and Brexit.Taking a slightly longer-term view, the table below shows the best and worst categories over three years:Unit trust category performance to June 30 2016Category3 year annualised returnBest&nbsp;Worldwide equity &#8211; unclassified26.18%Global real estate general21.11%Global equity general17.29%South African equity industrial16.62%Global multi-asset high equity16.54%Worst&nbsp;South African interest bearing variable term6.41%South African interest bearing short term6.34%South African interest bearing money market6.02%South African equity unclassified5.70%South African equity resources2.48%Source: PlexCrown Survey Q2 2016Once again the performance of global real estate general funds has been extremely positive. This is a fairly small category, but there are some funds building up very good track records, and given the limited nature of the local listed property space more investors are appreciating the diversification it offers.The only local category in the top five is South African equity industrial, which continued to deliver strong returns on the back of the incredible performance of large industrial counters. To a large degree, the rand hedge that many of these companies offer has played a big part.It is worth noting that not a single unit trust category delivered a negative average performance over the last three years. Even resource funds managed to turn positive thanks to the recent rally in commodity stocks.Over the past five years, this is how unit trust categories have performed:Unit trust category performance to June 30 2016Category5 year annualised returnBest&nbsp;Global real estate general23.07%Global equity general20.81%South African equity industrial20.13%Global multi-asset high equity19.94%Global multi-asset income18.35%Worst&nbsp;South African interest bearing short term6.34%South African interest bearing money market5.74%South African equity unclassified5.64%Worldwide equity unclassified4.29%South African equity resources-1.54%Source: PlexCrown Survey Q2 2016This table looks very similar to that over three years. Once again funds holding international assets dominate the top-performers, and local resource funds are at the bottom.The big change, however, is with the worldwide equity unclassified category and its single gold fund. It has slipped from the very top to the very bottom. Over ten years, the way things line up is very different:Unit trust category performance to June 30 2016Category10 year annualised returnBest&nbsp;South African equity industrial17.95%South African real estate general16.49%South African equity financials12.99%South African equity mid and small cap12.14%South African equity large cap11.81%Worst&nbsp;Regional interest bearing short term6.91%Regional equity general6.23%South African equity resources3.59%Worldwide equity unclassified2.54%Global equity unclassified0.00%Source: PlexCrown Survey Q2 2016Over the long term, the top performers are all categories focused on the JSE. Industrial funds lead the list, with real estate funds also delivering strong returns.While past performance cannot be taken as an indicator of what will happen in the future, investors should bear in mind that even though funds with an international focus have generally outperformed over the last five years, the best long-term returns have still come from the JSE. This doesn&#8217;t mean that one should invest locally ahead of offshore, but rather that it is always important to think about diversification so that you are not overexposed to one or the other.What emphasises this point even more is that the only local category amongst the worst performers is South African equity resources. Despite the rand having lost 50% of its value over this period, not all offshore investments have delivered.The clearest example is the global equity unclassified category and its single gold fund. Even though it shot the lights out in the past 12 months, it has only just got back to where it was ten years ago.
