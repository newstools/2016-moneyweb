JOHANNESBURG The passive investment market has been growing at double the rate of the overall collective investment scheme industry (effectively unit trusts and exchange-traded funds) over the last two years, but with assets under management of R61 billion it still only accounts for 3.1% of the total industry, a new analysis shows.This compares to a market share of 20% in the global space in 2015, according to the Nedgroup Investments Core Chartbook 2016.While the industry s growth trajectory seems to have gained impetus, Jannie Leach, head of core investments at Nedgroup Investments, believes it can easily grow three or four times in size by the end of 2020 if proposals around default regulations in the retirement space are introduced.National Treasury published draft default regulations for retirement funds for public comment in July last year.Default options are automatic choices made on behalf of members who do not exercise their choices in a given situation. There is currently no requirement for funds to provide default options, and where they exist, defaults often favour the interests of service providers, regularly working against the interests of members, National Treasury said at the time.The proposal seems to support passive investment strategies as a default option due to these investments often having lower charges and higher long run returns net of charges .But why do passive investments still only account for a meagre 3.1% of assets under management more than 15 years after the first local exchange-traded fund was launched? And this despite the fact that active managers have been struggling to outperform the index and a wide body of research in support of passive?Leach says it is in part related to the evolution of the industry.In the defined benefit retirement environment, employers carried the investment and longevity risk and life companies managed these challenges. The move to defined contribution funds transferred these risks to members and offered an opportunity for independent financial advisors and active managers to come to the party, particularly post-retirement.This industry has now reached maturity, Leach says.Without a mature industry, it is very difficult for passive investments to gain traction due to their low margin nature. In the absence of a mature industry that offers efficiencies, infrastructure and a distribution network for passive investments to piggyback on to make it financially viable, it is very difficult for passive to gain momentum, he argues.The most mature passive market is the US, where passive investments had a 26% market share in 2015, up from 24% in 2014.Source: Morningstar Direct/Nedgroup Investments*(* While passive strategies have traditionally referred to investments tracking market cap weighted indices, the term rules-based investing in the graph above encompasses all passive offerings including alternative strategies like smart beta and multi-asset passive funds.) Leach says due to the size of the US market, investors effectively only use two asset classes equities and bonds. But as a result of the significant diversity offered within these asset classes, single asset class index-trackers could gain traction much quicker. In other parts of the world, multi-asset strategies are more prevalent but up until recently it has been very difficult to find dedicated global Balanced Fund managers. Multi-managers or asset consultants are responsible for most of the asset allocation decisions.He expects however that life stage-type balanced solutions will make a significant impact going forward.The fact that passive investments still only comprise a small portion of the overall market is also linked to the dominance of a number of large active managers with strong brands and significant marketing budgets.Leach says the South African market is very brand loyal and advisors may choose a brand the client is familiar and comfortable with and likely to stick to.Should expectations of muted returns materialise over the next few years, the passive industry s cost advantage may also move more investors to consider these strategies.Leach says in an environment where annual returns are 17 or 18% paying an active fee of 2% is a completely different discussion than paying 2% when the return is only 9%. The fee as a percentage of the overall return will become increasingly important. Leach says for advisors the challenge is to add value without ending up with a costly total expense ratio (TER). The focus on fees will put pressure on advisors not to introduce unnecessary complexity in client portfolios.While a recent survey suggests that financial advisors have been somewhat reluctant to embrace passive strategies (see below), there is an expectation that this will change over time. At the moment, it is largely clients themselves that seem to be driving a move to passive.
