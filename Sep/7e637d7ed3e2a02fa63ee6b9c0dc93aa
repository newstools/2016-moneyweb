In interviews last week, following the announcement of Bain’s exit as the retail group’s owner, Edcon chief executive Bernie Brookes said this debt-to-equity transaction solved the “burning platform” on its debt. But, he admits, there’s a (linked) “second burning platform: its appeal to customers”. Here, there’s still a lot of work “to be done to get the product right, the price right, the range right”. But, I’d argue there’s a third burning platform and that is the group’s credit supply to customers which has rapidly constricted since the book’s sale to Barclays Africa (neé Absa) four years ago. Since that sale, Edcon (primarily Edgars) has lost half a million account customers, or 12% of its base. This wasn’t all Absa and Barclays’ doing, however… In the first five months after the deal, Edcon reported that “despite no changes being made to the acceptance criteria when Absa took over the trade receivables book, the total number of accounts decreased by approximately 55,000.” Looking further back – prior to the sale to Absa – its lost nearly 1 million customers from the peak in 2009.

The debtors book is not growing by anywhere near the level of its peers (in fact, in recent years it’s gone backwards). Astonishingly, less than 39% of Edcon’s retail sales are now on credit, from close to 52% at the time of the book’s sale. This compares very unfavourably with its competitors.   Edcon* TFG (excl.

The deal hasn’t exactly been a stunning success for Barclays Africa. After the R8.7 billion store card portfolio was acquired on November 1 2012, then-Absa Chairman Garth Griffin wrote: “The acquisition of the Edcon card book was an important step in expanding our customer base”. In the 50 months since, there’s been scant evidence of this. In the 2013 financial year, Barclays Africa reported a R229 million profit from the Edcon portfolio (as part of its broader Card business). This swung to a R9 million loss in 2014, with earnings of R88 million in the second-half. Between January and June 2014, the portfolio made a R97 million loss. The improvement in H2 continued with a R123 million profit in the 2015 full-year (not a single mention was made of the portfolio in Barclays Africa’s first-half 2016 results).   Click to enlarge.  Edcon saw this credit train-wreck coming. After all, it was a near-on forced seller in 2012. In its 2013 annual report (to March 2013), Edcon said: “The inability or unwillingness of Absa to provide support for our private label store card program may result in a decrease in store card sales to our customers, which could negatively impact our overall sales given customers’ reduced purchasing capacity”. And that’s precisely what’s happened. Faced with a rapidly deteriorating credit sales picture, it attempted to establish African Bank as a secondary credit provider in early 2014. That might’ve worked, but Abil itself collapsed in August. In Barclays Africa’s 2014 annual report, the bank noted that the board’s Group Risk and Capital Management Committee (GRCMC) commissioned a management presentation on “the Group’s exposure to Edcon” (amongst nine other presentations). This nervousness would’ve surely been pervasive in the broader market, given that Abil was unlikely to have been the retailer’s first choice. Edcon admitted in 2015 that “efforts to secure a third party second-look credit provider have stagnated in light of negative publicity about uncertainty around our capital structure”. The situation had become so grim that it started testing an “in-house second-look credit solution” (along with efforts to seek out an external “second-look credit provider to supplement the Absa funded credit proposition”). Edcon’s in-house solution has helped arrest the decline, or at least slow it significantly, and the group said in its 2016 financial statements (to March this year) that its internal “receivables book has returned acceptance rates to a healthier level”. This puts a finger in the proverbial dike but it simply isn’t a sustainable long-term solution. A second-look credit provider, even an in-house one, will make some difference at the margin (and it has). But the group’s best, most profitable credit customers are part of the book managed by Barclays Africa! (And as if this wasn’t enough, Edcon – like the broader industry – has been walloped by the new credit affordability regulations. It estimates a negative impact on retail sales of R297 million in its financial year to end-March 2016. In the first quarter of 2017 (April to June), Edcon puts the impact at R189 million. Truworths has previously estimated the impact of these changes on its 2016 FY retail sales of somewhere between R200 million and R250 million. Given the alignment of the relative reporting periods, i.e. to end June, both Truworths’ and Edcon’s estimates (R486 million in total) are for the first nine months since implementation.) Figuring a way out of this credit death grip is as important as fixing its appeal to customers. These two burning platforms are completely intertwined! Buying back the debtors book would surely be the desired outcome? I cannot see how relisting Edcon on the JSE (the stated plan) without it owning its debtors book is an option. Barclays Africa probably doesn’t need the distraction either – it’s got a complicated disentanglement from its former parent to manage. But, perhaps there is another way? At least Edcon has 12 million Thank U rewards customers on its books (although growth has all but flat-lined), by far the largest rewards programme in the country. It knows who these people are and what they buy. A somewhat useful start… * Hilton Tarrant works at immedia. He can still be contacted at hilton@moneyweb.co.za.
