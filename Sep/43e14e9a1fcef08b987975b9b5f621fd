JOHANNESBURG – A South African court on Friday upheld the government’s decision to block a tender for R12 billion ($850 million) of high-speed mobile broadband licences issued by the telecoms regulator. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) took the industry by surprise in July when it opened a tender to interested telecoms firms to bid for broadband licences known as spectrum. This prompted the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services to seek legal action to prevent the auction until the government had been properly consulted. ($1 = R13.98)
