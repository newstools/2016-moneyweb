South Africa&#8217;s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Tuesday that the country must tackle corruption and weak economic growth or face the risk of a credit rating downgrade to &#8220;junk&#8221; status.Credit ratings agencies are due to visit South Africa next week ahead of reviews of its credit ratings, he said at a business gala event. All three major agencies have warned that slowing growth and political infighting could trigger downgrades.&#8220;It is very important that we are able to recognise our weaknesses when they arise. We don&#8217;t need a downgrade to junk to wake all of us up,&#8221; he said.Ratings agency Moody&#8217;s has South Africa on a rating two notches above subinvestment, or &#8220;junk&#8221;, grade with a negative outlook, and it is due to publish its next review later this month. Fellow ratings firms Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch, whose reviews are also due before year-end, have the country just a step above junk.Gordhan also reiterated that he had not, while head of the tax department, overseen the setting up of a surveillance unit which police say illegally spied on politicians.Gordhan last month slashed the 2016 growth forecast for Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy to 0.5 percent from 0.9 percent, raising fears of a credit rating downgrade from Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and S&amp;P Global Ratings by year-end.Investors and the ratings agencies alike are worried that the police probe into Gordhan&#8217;s role in the surveillance unit could be part of a political ploy to pressure the Treasury into abandoning its prudent fiscal stance.
