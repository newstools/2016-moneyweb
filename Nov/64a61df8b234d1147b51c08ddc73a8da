South Africa&#8217;s rand gained against the dollar and bonds recouped some of the previous week&#8217;s big losses on Tuesday, but shares fell as weaker metals prices weighed on resource stocks.The rand had strengthened 1.80% to 14.173 per dollar by 23:50, easing slightly from a session high of 14.1050, lifted with other emerging markets by an easing of concerns over US president-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s fiscal expansion plans.&#8220;The time is just right for a correction on emerging market currencies because (they) have sold off very aggressively in the past week,&#8221; economist Jana van Deventer at ETM Analytics said.&#8220;The sell-off is not necessarily a true reflection of underlying fundamentals for these currencies,&#8221; she added.Bonds also gained, with the yield on benchmark government paper due in 2026 falling by 15 basis points to 9.065%.On the stock exchange, mining firms were the biggest losers among the blue chips as investors sold off base metals.Copper and iron ore prices fell on Tuesday, ending a week-long rally that bet on a period of heavy infrastructure spending under a president Donald Trump.Shares in Anglo American were down 7.5% at R194, while BHP Billiton shed 6.2% to R224.45.Telkom provided some support as its shares rose 5.3% to R62.89 after the fixed-line operator posted a 19.7% rise in half-year profit.The benchmark Top-40 index was 0.9% weaker at 43,088 points while the All-Share index fell 0.6% to 49,430 points.Trading was below average with around 229 million shares changing hands, compared with last year&#8217;s daily average of 296 million, according to preliminary bourse data.
