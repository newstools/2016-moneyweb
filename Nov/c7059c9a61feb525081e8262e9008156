When former public protector Thuli Madonsela approached parliament for extra funding to conduct her office&#8217;s investigation into state capture, she was given only a fraction of what she asked for. She was granted only R1.5 million for the exercise.This would never be enough to conduct the comprehensive investigation that the complaints required. In a sense, it was restricting the public protector&#8217;s ability to conduct a proper investigation.Madonsela, however, would ultimately prove the fruitlessness of such tactics. The remedial action set down in the State of Capture report released on Wednesday are a stroke of genius.Since the powers of the public protector had been confirmed by the Constituational Court, Madonsela knew that her remedial actions had to be implemented. So if parliament would not grant her office the resources it needed to conduct a proper investigation upon her request, she would simply instruct the state to fund an investigation by other means.And thus, in the report&#8217;s remedial actions the president is instructed to set up a commission of enquiry, and National Treasury has to ensure that the commission is adequately resourced .This brilliantly circumvents the attempts to hamstring her office&#8217;s investigation, and confirms her legacy as a public servant who refused to be cowed. Bravo Ms Madonsela! South Africa will always be in your debt.
