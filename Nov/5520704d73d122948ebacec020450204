Futuregrowth Asset Management, South Africa s largest specialist fixed-income money manager, is to resume lending to the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) with immediate effect.The asset manager s decision comes after completing a review of the IDC s governance structures and lending policies and practices.In a statement, Futuregrowth said it reviewed the IDC board s independence, autonomy, and decision making rights and commitment to fiduciary responsibility.It found the relationship between the development financier s board and its shareholder, the Economic Development Department positive and constructive . Futuregrowth considers the 13 member IDC Board to be appropriately constituted with a satisfactory balance of skills, experience and independence, it said. In addition, Futuregrowth assessed the IDC s lending policies and practices in order to gather evidence that decisions are made in accordance with their mandate, established processes and the requirements of applicable legislation, the asset manager said.It also found the IDC s Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Policy to be adequate in its current form but noted that its mandate to grant loans to PEPs, in line with well developed policies for lending to PEPs , may give rise to risks.The terms of its agreement with the IDC will be subject to ongoing public reporting requirements, mutually acceptable and appropriate protections in future legal agreements and Futuregrowth s ongoing satisfaction with governance structures, it said. As part of the engagement with Futuregrowth, there were some recommendations regarding enhanced transparency and public disclosures relating to governance structures, IDC chief financial officer Nonkululeko Dlamini said in a separate statement.Dlamini also reaffirmed the development financier&#8217;s commitment to maintaining high levels of corporate governance, independent decision making and protecting its funders interests. Futuregrowth, a subsidiary of the Old Mutual Group, froze all lending to the IDC, the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, Eskom, the South African National Roads Agency and Transnet over governance concerns at the state owned enterprises in August 2016.It resumed lending to the Land Bank in late September, after reviewing its governance and investor protection mechanisms.
