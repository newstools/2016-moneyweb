JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s deputy finance minister said on Thursday that patronage and corruption were undermining efforts for a credible government, a day after an audit showed the government had made $3 billion in irregular expenditure this financial year.South Africa&#8217;s political elite has been involved in a slew of corruption scandals which have eroded the trust of investors and weighed on Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy. Ratings agencies have warned of downgrades before the end of the year.Mcebisi Jonas&#8217; remarks in a speech at a labour congress came a day after the auditor-general said irregular expenditure by government departments swelled 80% to R43.4 billion ($3 billion) in the 2015-16 financial year.&#8220;Leadership that looks beyond its own narrow confines is needed,&#8221; Jonas said, adding that &#8220;patronage and corruption had undermined efforts to build a credible government&#8221;.Last week President Jabob Zuma survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote over allegations of influence-peddling, one of several scandals involving him since taking office in 2009. The 74-year-old has shown no intention of wanting to resign.As deputy finance minister, Jonas has been an outspoken critic of government graft. In October he said &#8220;Corruption is real, it&#8217;s palpable, you can feel it.&#8221;On Thursday he also said that ratings agencies were concerned about Pretoria&#8217;s ability to maintain fiscal targets but Treasury had &#8220;convinced them&#8221; that it could maintain caps on spending.&#8220;We&#8217;ve done what could be done. My sense is that there is general acceptance of the constraints,&#8221; Jonas told reporters after his speech.
