When Coronation listed on the JSE in 2003 it had assets under management (AUM) of R53.6 billion. That number nearly tripled over the next four years to reach R134 billion by the end of September 2007.The company&#8217;s AUM understandably dropped over the following year due to the market crash that followed the global financial crisis. In 2008, the company reported AUM of R125 billion.For the following seven years, however, Coronation enjoyed an incredible period of growth. Its AUM climbed to R610 billion by 2015, and it had become the largest asset manager in the country.That positive run has, however, come to an end. In reporting full year results to the end of September on Tuesday, Coronation revealed that its AUM had slipped by 1.8% to R599 billion.The company explained that the drop was due to conditions in the retail and institutional markets, as well as its decision to close its equity and multi-asset institutional mandates to new business. The formal retirement savings market in South Africa has seen net outflows for the last few years, particularly in the private pension fund market, where we&#8217;ve seen gross outflows of 8.1% of opening market value over the last year, Coronation CEO Anton Pillay explained to Moneyweb. That has increased from around 4.5% in 2008. Over that same period, we&#8217;ve seen a consistent level of contributions of between 4% and 5%, he added. So from an industry perspective, it&#8217;s a net outflow market. When you combine that with our closure of those two strategies and our inability to attract new clients into those mandates, which represent a significant part of our business, that has an effect on the inflows we can attract. The decline in AUM also highlights the cyclical nature of Coronation&#8217;s business. It is a story that is clearly told in the company&#8217;s share price.Between late 2012 and the end of 2015 Coronation&#8217;s share price moved from R23 per share to a high of R115 per share, representing a more than 400% gain. Since then, however, things have been less rosy for shareholders. Coronation&#8217;s share price fell back under R50 per share by the start of this year, but has since recovered to its current levels around R72 per share.What this shows is that during the strong market bull run that ended in mid-2014 Coronation performed exceptionally well. High market returns and strong fund performance translated into high revenues through fees and performance fees.It has, however, become a little more difficult for the company in recent times. In addition to the drop in its AUM, Coronation&#8217;s annual results show a decline in revenue for the second consecutive year. For the 12 months to September 30 2016 the asset manager generated revenue of R4.046 billion, down from R4.442 billion in 2015.In 2014, Coronation&#8217;s revenue had reached a high of R4.774 billion. To put that in context, ten year&#8217;s earlier in 2004 the company&#8217;s revenue was just R389 million. We&#8217;ve always said that we&#8217;re a cyclical business and as a result our revenue is determined by the market return and the out-performance we are able to generate, Pillay explained.However, the company&#8217;s business model does allow it to compensate for this to some extent through a variable cost base. For the second year in a row, Coronation was also able to bring down its operating costs from R2.090 billion last year to R2.019 billion in 2016. If you look at our total cost base, just under R600 million represents our fixed operational costs, Pillay explained. The balance is variable costs. Coronation&#8217;s business is also highly cash generative, which means that it continues to be able to pay out generous dividends. Once again, the company paid out 100% of its earnings to shareholders.Headline earnings per share came in at 447.6 cents, and Coronation announced a total annual dividend of 447 cents per share. Our dividend policy states that we will pay out at least 75% of earnings as dividends, and for the last few years we&#8217;ve paid out 100%, Pillay said. We&#8217;ve done that this year again. That means is that the counter is trading on a dividend yield of over 6% per share.
