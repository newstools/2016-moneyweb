South Africa s youngest woman to win Bwasa s Business Woman of the Year award in 1998 &#8211; Nkonki CEO Sindi Zilwa &#8211; knows all too well that success doesn t occur within one strike, or one big, dramatic step.In fact, when she and her brother opened the doors of their independent, black-owned auditing firm in 1993, their first clients consisted of what she calls box drops . These are clients who arrive with all of their accounting books and records thrown together randomly in a big box &#8211; which the client then unceremoniously drops at the office for the firm to sort through, organise and file. Glorified filing if you will.So how many steps were involved before her company became one of South Africa s top auditing firms, using high tech, sophisticated accounting systems and accredited to audit JSE-listed companies, as well as companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange?In this (1 56 ) extract from a full-length, in-depth video interview, Zilwa speaks frankly about the patience and stamina required to run (and win) the business leadership marathon .Watch the full-length interview here.In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people.
