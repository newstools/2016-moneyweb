JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African retailer Lewis said its six-month profit dropped 39.6%, hit by the challenging economy and new credit approval regulations affecting consumer spending.Headline earnings per share (Heps) fell from 322.6 cents to 194.8 cents, in line with its forecast, for the six months ended September 30.&#8220;The challenging economic and consumer environment in the country, coupled with the ongoing impact of the National Credit Regulator&#8217;s affordability assessment regulations, has severely impacted the group&#8217;s merchandise sales and in particular credit sales,&#8221; the company said in a statement.The credit affordability assessment requires customers to provide their latest pay slips or bank statements before they can get credit.&#8220;This is proving a major challenge for many consumers in the group&#8217;s lower- to middle-income target market who are self-employed or work in the informal sector, restricting their access to credit,&#8221; Lewis said.Shares in Lewis fell 1.10% to R36 by 09:05.Group credit sales declined by 2.3% and accounted for 63.4% of total sales, while revenue declined by 2% to R2.7 billion ($198.99 million).Lewis declared an interim dividend of 100 cents per share which represents a 55% payout of the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders.The company said trading conditions are not expected to improve over the remainder of the financial year as consumers face increasing pressures on disposable income, the company said.($1 = 13.5685 rand)
