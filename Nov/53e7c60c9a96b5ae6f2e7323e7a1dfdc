Liberty is listing a portion of its iconic property portfolio on the JSE in December, under the name Liberty Two Degrees.Alongside the well-known Sandton City, Eastgate and Melrose Arch properties, it also owns Nelson Mandela Square, the Liberty Promenade (in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town), the Liberty Midlands Mall (in Pietermaritzburg) as well as a handful of smaller retail and office assets. After listing, Two Degrees will own 22% of the Liberty property portfolio (with the remainder being owned directly by Liberty).Very simply, Liberty Two Degrees aims to raise R2.8 billion by way of a private placement to invited investors as well as a subscription by Liberty (using its policyholders funds). Liberty (using its shareholders funds) may sell up to 100 million of its 310.5 million units (which it would ve received in exchange for the stake in the property portfolio).In listing on the JSE (including the private placement), Liberty Two Degrees will incur R130 million in expenses. This compares relatively unfavourably with recent recognisable property listings, and among the larger capital raisings (in other words, excluding Tower Property Fund which is included below to illustrate that these costs are only variable to a point). The costs incurred by Investec in the listing of its locally-focused fund are skewed by the fact that it paid a total of R13.5 million to its investment bank in fees (a handy discount to the market rate). And, out of the remainder, only one (accounting and auditing) was higher than R500,000!&nbsp;Listing DateCompanyTransaction costsProceedsCost per R1m raised06 Dec 16Liberty Two DegreesR130mR2.8bn*R46,42908 Dec 14Pivotal Property FundR28.6mR1.02bnR28,03512 Dec 13Accelerate Property FundR39.7mR2bnR19,40214 Oct 13AttacqR24.2mR800m*R30,27919 Jul 13Tower Property FundR22.9mR300mR76,26114 Apr 11Investec Property FundR16.3mR1.7bnR9,577* Estimated proceedsSource: Author s research of company pre-listing statements&nbsp;Of interest in the Liberty Two Degrees listing is an amount of R31 million set aside for pre-commitment fees . The joint bookrunners are effectively able to pay each qualifying investor ( certain potential investors that meet minimum pre-commitment requirements ) a pre-commitment fee of 1% of the amount committed.In other words, these qualifying investors will receive a 1% discount / payback on their subscription in the form of this pre-commitment fee.As at the last practicable date, Liberty Two Degrees has received pre-commitments from qualifying investors for an aggregate amount of R853 million worth of Liberty Two Degrees units at a subscription price of R10.00 per unit . This means, says the company, the aggregate pre-commitment fee payable to qualifying investors amounts to R8 530 000 .This fee is not a common feature of private placements on our local bourse. The only other recent listing which made provision for a payment like this, using the description pre-commitment fee was Echo Polska Properties which listed in September. Its bookrunner (Java Capital) was mandated to offer certain investors a pre-commitment fee, provided that the aggregate amount paid to all qualifying investors shall not exceed an amount of EUR 835 000. No provision had yet been made for any such payment at the time of the issuing of its pre-listing statement.In Liberty Two Degrees case, this R31 million in (probable) fees equates to a quarter of listing expenses! Surely, with a portfolio of such well-known assets, it need not be paying what amounts to an incentive to qualifying investors who commit capital?!Strip out these pre-commitment fees , and both Liberty Two Degrees and Dis-Chem will pay approximately R35,000 for every R1 million raised. That is strangely comparable but, as argued previously on Moneyweb in relation to Dis-Chem, is still on the high side.When comparing the costs incurred by Liberty Two Degrees with those estimated by Dis-Chem in its listing earlier this month, both the fees paid to investment banks as well as the audit fees look especially out of whack for the latter. The pharmacy group did, however, (intend to) place shares with institutional investors in the United States which would ve been more expensive. Liberty Two Degrees offer is open to South African (invited) investors only.&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberty Two DegreesDis-ChemAmount raisedR2.8 billionR4.325 billionListing expensesR130 millionR149 millionCost per R1m raisedR46,429R34,451Cost per R1m raised, excl. pre-commitment feesR35,357 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks (acting as bookrunners)R66 millionR116.8 millionJSE-related feesR878,108R500,000Legal feesR27.4 millionR19.2 millionAudit fees/reporting accountantsR2.2 millionR9.8 millionPre-commitment feesR31 million &nbsp;As an aside, Standard Bank s corporate and investment unit has scored very well indeed in these two recent large listings. For Liberty Two Degrees, it is acting as Joint Corporate Advisor, Sponsor and Bookrunner and will presumably be paid R33 million (half of the R66 million in fees for listing and placement of the units) for its effort work. For the listing of Dis-Chem, Standard Bank was Joint Global Coordinator, Joint Transaction Sponsor and Joint Bookrunner and was paid R26.3 million.
