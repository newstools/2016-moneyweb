JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African stocks and rand currency were firmer on Tuesday, amid cautious optimism that Hillary Clinton would win the US election.Caught in a narrow range for most of the session, the rand was up 0.13% at 13.3475 to the greenback by 1516 GMT, compared with Monday&#8217;s New York close.Investors are hoping Clinton, who is expected to pursue market friendly policies, will prevail against her opponent Donald Trump.&#8220;If Trump were to secure a win, we&#8217;d expect the dollar to fall against some of the major developed currencies such as the yen, the Swiss franc and probably the euro, but rally against emerging market currencies,&#8221; Standard Bank said in a note.&#8220;This is predicated on the view that a Trump win would generate risk aversion, with assets such as stocks, bonds &#8211; and emerging market currencies &#8211; selling off. This could see the rand closer to 14.00.&#8221;On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index rose 0.81% to 44,199 points while the All-Share index gained 0.79% to 50,700 points.&#8220;The market is probably pricing in that Hilary Clinton is going to win the elections but there still is a little bit of uncertainty there,&#8221; said Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies.Banking stocks built on gains from the previous session, reaching their highest level in over three months with Standard Bank rising 3.29% to R151.20, FirstRand gaining 4.27% to R51.76 and Nedbank Group strengthening 2.40% to R232.95.Weighed down by a drop in the price of gold, Sibanye Gold fell 2.57% to R36.40 and AngloGold Ashanti lost 1.56% to R177.51.On the bond market, government bonds closed on a firmer footing, with the yield for 10-year debt, the benchmark for the market, shedding 2.5 basis points to 8.66%.
