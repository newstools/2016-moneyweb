This article follows an exchange with Byron Lotter on Twitter (see here) after what I (and seemingly the market) believe was a very poor trading update from Woolworths (WHL).But Woolies is not alone in this regard.Here are the key listed retailers, their like-for-like same-store growth, inflation and the resulting indication of volumes at store-level:&nbsp;So cyclical, discretionary non-food related like-for-like retailer volumes contracted by 7.3% over the latest reporting cyclical, across pretty much our entire listed retail sector.That is not good.But why is this happening? For a number of reasons, so let me list them for you briefly:So, all in all, a combination of factors are converging to make this a very tough retail environment, yet there is an elephant in the room: retailers themselves have been growing their own debt-levels and gearing has been exploding, while their returns on equity (ROE) have been falling (see below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So not only have retailers been using more and more debt to finance themselves, but they&#8217;ve been doing this at incrementally lower returns.And then, on top of that we start to have falling volumes in even some defensive categories .?The point is, South African retail is in trouble. This, in a way, is acknowledged by the fact that many of the retail groups are desperately acquiring businesses outside of South Africa. If South Africa was a good retail investment, why wouldn t these groups deploy their capital in South Africa?It is simple, we are not. Hence, they are not.I ll write a bit later on the full effects of this, but consider the following: retail REITs (i.e. listed collections of shopping centres) have a historical beta with the listed retailers that approaches 1.0x.In other words, if local retailers struggle, rental escalation cannot be passed onto them, rental holidays appear, vacancies eventually materialise and highly-indebted shopping centres get impaired. And, within highly-geared REIT structures, when net asset value drops then loan-to-values are breached, distributions are the first thing to be cut, and and and . I m sure you get the picture.This is a lot of doom and gloom, but consider this parting thought: have your shopping habits changed in the last year or two? Think about it .This article was first published on SmallCaps.co.za here, and republished with permission.
