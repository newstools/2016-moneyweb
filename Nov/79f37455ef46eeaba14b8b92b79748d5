Botswana will sell a 600 megawatt Chinese-built power plant after persistent technical problems since it was commissioned in 2012, the country&#8217;s state electricity firm said on Saturday.Botswana&#8217;s Morupule B coal-fired power station, built by the China National Electric Equipment Corporation at a cost of $970 million, has often broken down, leading to a reliance on diesel generators and imports from South Africa.&#8220;Morupule B has proven to be costly to maintain and operate due to construction defects rendering the plant unreliable,&#8221; Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) chief Stefan Schwarzfischer said in an notice to staff.The sale would take 6 to 12 months, he added.A joint venture between Japan&#8217;s Marubeni Corp and South Korea&#8217;s Posco Energy won an $800 million tender in March to expand the Morupule B plant by 300 MW.BPC has been running at a loss for eight years and is implementing a turnaround strategy after posting a 1.9 billion pula ($180 million) operating loss in the 2015/16 financial year. It also received 2.3 billion in government subsidies.
