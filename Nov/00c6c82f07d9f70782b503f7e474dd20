UNITED NATIONS &#8211; United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday he hopes the administration of Donald Trump will &#8220;strengthen the bonds of international cooperation&#8221; and described Hillary Clinton as &#8220;a powerful symbol of women&#8217;s empowerment.&#8221;&#8220;In the aftermath of a hard-fought and often divisive campaign, it is worth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country&#8217;s greatest strengths. I encourage all Americans to stay true to that spirit,&#8221; Ban said after Trump&#8217;s presidential election victory.&#8220;People everywhere look to the United States to use its remarkable power to help lift humanity up and to work for the common good,&#8221; Ban told reporters.
