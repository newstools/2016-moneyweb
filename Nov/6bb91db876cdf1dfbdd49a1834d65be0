European banks will need to increase provisions by 18 percent on average to meet new rules on accounting for potential loan losses, according to the European Banking Authority.The accounting standards known as IFRS 9, which are set to apply from 2018, will also take a toll on lenders balance sheets, shaving an average of 59 basis points from their top-quality capital ratios, according to the EBA study published on Thursday. The estimates were based on a survey of about 50 banks of all sizes across the 28-nation bloc, with most categorized as being of systemic importance either globally or domestically.Behind one of the largest changes to accounting rules this century is the experience of the 2008 financial crisis, when lenders found themselves unable to make provisions against impairment until the losses were actually incurred. The new standards require banks to cover potential losses as soon as a loan is made, based on the expected shortfall indicated by their models. The impact is mainly driven by the impairment requirements, said Delphine Reymondon, head of the capital, assets and liabilities management unit at the London-based EBA. Most banks estimated at this stage a manageable impact on their capital ratios, she said.The EBA, which launched the study in December last year, is planning a second assessment that will conclude around the end of the first quarter to better understand the impact and implementation of the new standard. The current study helped focus the attention of banks top management on the new standard, Reymondon said. Most of the banks are still in the design phase, she said. We have observed that larger banks are usually more advanced than smaller ones. 2016 Bloomberg L.P
