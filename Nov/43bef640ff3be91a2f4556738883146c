In yet another stunning, completely unpredicted result in a mature democracy, Donald Trump overturned every credible poll and most of the mainstream consensus that expected a Hillary Clinton victory.The unexpected result, and the uncertainty of what a Trump Presidency will mean for economic policy in the world s biggest economy induced anxiety and fear that send investors heading for the comfort of gold.As voting started yesterday, the gold price spiked from levels around $1 270 an ounce to well over $1 330 as early results indicated Trump leading. At lunchtime (1pm) in South Africa, the price had moderated somewhat as the result became a certainty and gold was trading a tad above $1 300 an ounce.Rhona O Connell, Head of Metals at Thomson Reuters GFMS, provides her thoughts on the impact to the gold industry: There s been a relatively muted reaction from gold overall, certainly by comparison with the reaction to the Brexit vote. The fact that gold has not broken through that important technical level and has already attracted some producer selling means that the markets are sitting on their hands and this shouldn t really come as too much of a surprise. It s important to remember that headline grabbing policies are likely to be tempered by advisors and on that basis I would expect gold to mark time for now.On balance, though, we should probably expect the market to develop a buy-on-dips pattern rather than selling rallies, especially if we are heading for an economic phase that raises the spectre of a widening budget deficit. At one point early this morning, the rand had been sent as high as R13.80 to the US dollar, but this had also moderated to R13.50 to the dollar by lunchtime.The net result: gold equities have been the big winner on the JSE, with Sibanye up 7.9%, Gold Fields 6.9% and Anglo Gold 6.6%. What has also caught the attention of investment managers has been the strong performance of the diversified miners, most notably BHP Billiton, up 6.8%, and Anglo American up 4.8%. Interesting to note that the base metals, generally, are also stronger this morning (and not just in dollar terms), also reflecting the fact that some uncertainty has been taken out, says O Connell.Trump spoke at length in his acceptance speech about rebuilding the nation s infrastructure, and perhaps the markets are taking this seriously.
