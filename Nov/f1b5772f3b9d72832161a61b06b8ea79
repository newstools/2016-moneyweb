JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand tumbled as much as four percent on Wednesday along with other emerging market currencies as investors were rattled by a shock US election win for Republican Donald Trump.But South Africa&#8217;s main stock index ended slightly higher, boosted by a surge in gold miners as investors sought safe havens.A politicial outsider, Trump is seen as a risk to global growth as he has pledged to renegotiate trade deals, impose high import tariffs and stirred fears of a currency war with China.By 1515 GMT the rand had weakened 3% to 13.5900 per dollar after falling to session low of 13.8300, its weakest since October 31.&#8220;The question now is what will a Trump victory mean for the performance of SSA (sub-Saharan Africa) markets. Near-term in any risk off environment, the ZAR (rand) is likely to be most impacted,&#8221; said Razia Khan, chief economist, Africa at Standard Chartered bank.&#8220;As the market focus gradually shifts to the kind of policy we are likely to see, and the implications of a Republican Congress and Presidency both in favour of further fiscal stimulus, there are likely to be more meaningful implications for SSA markets.&#8221;Government bonds weakened alongside the currency, and the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 added 17 basis points to 8.83%.&#8220;Overall, though, it will take time for the markets to fully digest the impact of a Trump victory and to understand whether or not Trump&#8217;s extreme rhetoric will translate into actual economic and political policy or whether the institutional strength of the US will take the best of Trump&#8217;s suggestions in order to meaningfully lift economic growth,&#8221; Stanlib Chief Economist Kevin Lings said.The benchmark JSE Top-40 index was up 0.63% at 44,479 and the broader All-share index gained 0.49% to 50,950.Gold mining stocks added the most points to index, climbing 4.8%, with Gold Fields up 5% and rival AngloGold Ashanti 4.3% higher.
