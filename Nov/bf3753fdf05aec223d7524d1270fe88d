The average per kilometre pace for the world marathon (42.2km) record is about 2m54s per km, which could be seen to be rather sedentary when compared with Usain Bolt s record of 1m36s if Usain was able to maintain his speed for the standard marathon distance of 42.2km (he would complete the marathon in around in 63 minutes, beating the current world marathon record by nearly an hour!).Clearly maintaining a sprinter&#8217;s pace over such a long distance at this pace is not humanly possible, yet often retirement plans are expected to attain and maintain a Herculean investment pace over an inappropriate length of time. This is, however, often the expectation of retirees-in-waiting who, after 30 years of plying their trade, are now five to ten years away from retirement and are faced with the realisation that their retirement savings are actually insufficient for their golden years.Suddenly they are confronted with seemingly unbelievable calculations, performed by a retirement planner called in to assist in providing a solution to enable the candidate retirees to meet their financial retirement needs. These mathematical calculations, usually based on a required rate of return on investment of the available capital, may indicate that what is required may be:(a) additional cash injections of Titanic proportions and/or, (b) Harry Potter-conjured investment returns hitherto unknown in the investment world and/or, (c) that the anticipated retirement date may need to be postponed or, (d) that post-retirement employment needs to be sought.Not believing these options, our retirees-in-waiting then turn to the financial media in search of alternative solutions and here they will be confronted with a plethora of opinions as to how much is enough to have in the bank for a comfortable retirement, varying opinions as to how this amount is to be scientifically calculated, all the while ruing time and the opportunities lost to discuss this important matter with qualified persons over the years.Sadly, many will contact advertisers offering high rates of investment return and be lured into inappropriate investments, often without being made aware of the concomitant risk that accompanies those investments.Six steps to avoid under-funding your retirement Warren Buffet, considered by many to be one of the world s most successful investors says; to invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insight or inside information. What is needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.
