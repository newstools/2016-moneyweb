Business confidence in South Africa recovered in October after slumping to its lowest in three decades in the previous month, boosted by a jump in export volumes and a firmer currency, a survey showed on Wednesday.The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry&#8217;s (Sacci) monthly business index rose to 93.0 in October, its highest reading in three months, from 90.3 in September.&#8220;Positive monthly contributions mainly came from merchandise export volumes, the rand exchange rate, merchandise import volumes and real retail trade,&#8221; Sacci said.Having slipped to one-month lows in mid-October after the state prosecutor said Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would face fraud charges, the rand has since recovered after the charges were dropped, firming more than 9% against the dollar according to Thomson Reuters data.The business body however warned that the recovery was &#8220;against the odds of slow domestic and global economic performance and local socio-political distractions&#8221;, and that the business mood would suffer if the country was downgraded.&#8220;An investment downgrade to junk status could make the process of economic recovery more cumbersome and costly,&#8221; Sacci said.Credit ratings agencies are due to visit South Africa in the coming weeks and publish their reviews by year-end. All three major agencies have warned that slowing growth and political infighting could trigger downgrades.
