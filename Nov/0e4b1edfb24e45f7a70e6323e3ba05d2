Eskom s bond yields might rise in the short-term, but the country s long-term credit rating will probably not be affected following the news Brian Molefe will be resigning from his position at Eskom. Molefe said on Friday that despite not been given the right to respond to the observations made in the damning Public Protector s report, he would be resigning for the good of the country.Given that Eskom accounts for over R170 billion in government guarantees, the question became what would happen to Eskom, and by default South Africa s credit rating now that he is gone? It s probably not positive for Eskom in the short-term, says economist Mike Schussler. He thinks the uncertainty around who might succeed Molefe and the future direction the utility might take will not be enjoyed by the markets.With respect to the country s own credit rating, the ratings agencies look less at who the individuals are and more at what the country needs, says Schussler. So it is unlikely they will make any decision based on this development. Schussler thinks if the new CEO takes the utility in a different direction, i.e. away from the incessant drum for nuclear expansion, it might be good for Eskom in the long-term. I do not see this as a positive, says Nomura economist, Peter Attard Montalto. They will appoint someone equally as willing to facilitate rent extraction and ensure nuclear success and as long as the board is in place and other senior management, nothing changes. If the CFO is appointed CEO that is not positive and would be a sign of status quo.
