JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed to near three-week highs against the dollar and yields on government bonds fell on Monday after rating agencies Fitch and Moody&#8217;s affirmed the country&#8217;s investment-grade credit ratings.The market&#8217;s focus was also on scandal-plagued President Jacob Zuma, who is facing a vote of no-confidence by the ruling party&#8217;s executive committee.Some analysts said Zuma&#8217;s hand would be weakened by the challenge even if he survived the vote &#8211; as expected &#8211; boosting sentiment in financial markets that see him as a liability.Stocks fell led by a sell-off in the resources sector, as the rand&#8217;s recent strength made companies who earn the lion&#8217;s share of their revenue outside South Africa, among them mining firms, less attractive.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country, forecast to grow by 0.5% this year, has been trying to avert a sovereign rating downgrade to junk status that would raise borrowing costs and deter investment.Fitch and Moody&#8217;s affirmed South Africa&#8217;s investment-grade credit ratings late on Friday.At 23:55, the rand was at 13.7179 per dollar, a gain of 2.23% from its New York close on Friday. The currency was trading at its firmest levels since November 10, according to Thomson Reuters data.&#8220;The rand has had a gap open this morning which is likely due to the combination of a weaker dollar but also the positive news from the rating agencies,&#8221; Standard Bank chief currency trader Warrick Butler said in a note.&#8220;If markets perceive that the president could be weaken, whether that happens or not is not irrelevant, if they believe it to be so then the currency will strengthen,&#8221; NKC Independent Economists political analyst Gary van Staden said.Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns however said that the markets should be cautious about expecting too much from the vote, &#8220;having been disappointed so often in the past.&#8221;The yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 fell 25 basis points to 8.870%.On the stock market, the Top-40 index fell 1.34% to 43,617 points while the broader all-share dropped 0.99% to 50,194 points.The mining sector fell 2.7% leading the bourse lower, with platinum miner Lonmin tumbling 4.50% to R28.41.Further losses were curbed by a resurgent banking sector , which firmed by 3%, led by FirstRand whose shares rose 3.29% to R52.17.
