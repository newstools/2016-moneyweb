Although income-chasing investors typically bet on heavyweight property companies with scale, liquidity and which are fervent deal-makers, mid-cap counters are also increasingly staking a claim in SA s listed property sector, which is worth more than R350 billion.Among the mid-cap counters is Accelerate Property Fund, with a market capitalisation of R5.8 billion. Accelerate s stock still offers investors an affordable entry into listed property at a forward yield of about 9% compared with the whole sector which is trading at 7.8%.The company had a busy year of juggling its much-talked-about redevelopment of the Fourways Mall in Johannesburg and more recently, its foray into Europe.In line with many property companies diversifying into Central and Eastern Europe given SA s worrying state of the economy, Accelerate is in the process of acquiring nine retail warehouse properties in Austria and Slovakia for 82 million (R1.2 billion).The properties are tenanted by Germany-based do-it-yourself retailer OBI GmbH &amp; Co.Accelerate s chief operating officer Andrew Costa says its recent offshore deals are a stepping stone for more transactions in Austria and Slovakia. It took us 11 months to find this deal as we had to make sure we bought the right properties at the right price. We even had to make sure that we have the right partners. There are more development opportunities on these properties and further greenfield developments, Costa tells Moneyweb.It has taken its offshore strategy further by creating Accelerate Europe, which is domiciled in the Netherlands, and might be listed on an overseas stock exchange in the long-term as a separate entity.The plan is for Accelerate to derive 25% of its rental income from offshore markets.The big draw card for the company in Europe is that yields on properties are typically higher than the cost of debt which instantly boosts dividend payouts in year one. In Austria for example, Costa says yields on properties on average are 7% (or 11% to 11.5% in rand terms) and the cost of debt is below 2%. In SA, borrowing costs are more than 9% and yields are typically less than 8%.Grindrod Asset Management s chief investment officer Ian Anderson says Accelerate s Europe deals provide it secure rental income that requires a lot less work. [It also] allows management to focus on delivering shareholder value through their development pipeline as well as through their considered acquisition strategy, says Anderson.Accelerate revealed its Europe ambitions after releasing its results for the six months to September 30, in which the company grew dividend payouts by 8.1% and the value of its property portfolio grew by 17% to R9.1 billion.Says Stanlib&#8217;s Ahmed Motara: &#8220;No quantitative guidance was given for 2017, which always increases the forecast risk when one looks at a property stock. Overall, the 8.1% dividend growth showed growth above inflation.&#8221;Underscoring the extent of its deal-making is its loan-to-value (LTV), which grew to 40.5% from 35.6% during March rated relatively high by market watchers. Costa says its LTV can go as high as 50% to support further deals.Accelerate, just like many property companies, is starting to feel the pinch from SA s tough economy. Vacancies marginally rose to 7.7% from 7.1% in March and rental escalations dropped from 8% to 7.8%.SA acquisitions and Fourways MallIts focus in SA is equally busy having acquired approximately 50% of the Portside Tower in Cape Town (believed to be the tallest office building in the city, standing at 139 metres) for R755 million, a coup for Accelerate. Post reporting period, it bought the Eden Meander Lifestyle Centre in George for R365 million at a yield of 9.1%.Arguably, much of its focus has been on the redevelopment of Fourways Mall, located in a mushrooming node that many believe has the potential to take on neighbouring Sandton.Accelerate is redeveloping Fourways Mall, its largest asset valued at R2.4 billion, to grow the shopping mall from 61 480 sqm to a gigantic 170 000 sqm. Upon completion in mid-2018, Fourways Mall will join Gateway Theatre of Shopping in Durban, Canal Walk in Cape Town and Sandton City in Johannesburg as among the biggest shopping malls in SA.The mall is nearly 80% pre-let in terms of the retail space and already phase one of the development, which includes a new food court anchored by a Bounce store (believed to be the biggest in SA at 4 000 sqm), will be completed in December. The mall comes at a time when there are concerns about the oversupply of shopping malls, heightened by the recent opening of Mall of Africa, which is a nearly 30 minutes drive to Fourways Mall.
