Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Policy positionsPresident-Elect Donald Trump is showing signs that he intends to follow through on his campaign promises. His transition team have pledged to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, a move that saw a bank rally yesterday, with Wells Fargo &amp; C0 climbing 7.8%. The election winner&#8217;s website also gave some details on the plan to abolish Obamacare. On immigration, one of Trump&#8217;s signature campaign issues, all signs are that he intends to carry out sweeping reform. And yes, the wall is still there. EM routThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 2.1%, while EM carry-trades are unwinding, as climbing Treasury yields undermine the case for riskier government debt. The rout doesn&#8217;t mean there are no opportunities in developing markets. One of the few bright spots is Chinese shares as the Shanghai Composite Index entering a bull market, with metal producers leading gains. BondsThe global bond sell-off continues apace this morning, with yields on Italy&#8217;s 10-year debt climbing above 2% for the first time in 14 months. Across the world, more than $1 trillion has been wiped off the value of bonds as President-Elect Trump&#8217;s policies are seen boosting inflation. US bond-market bears have turned into winners as their contrarian calls for yields to rise come to fruition.Markets dropOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8% while Japan&#8217;s Topix index added 0.1%. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.1% lower at 5:21am ET, with the benchmark still on track for its best week since July. S&amp;P 500 futures were little changed.Tech slumpThe so-called FANG stocks Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet, each closed more than 1.9% lower yesterday as concerns over Trump&#8217;s trade policies weighed them down. Investors&#8217; expectations of a future Trump presidency also afflicted Tesla Motors Inc., which closed 2.5% lower, as clean-energy policies may get less attention under the new administration.
