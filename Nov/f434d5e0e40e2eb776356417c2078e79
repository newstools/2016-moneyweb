The salaries of the four directors of Nova Property Group have been extremely controversial and a comparison to industry salaries clearly shows that they may be grossly overpaid. This has a significant impact on the company&#8217;s cash flow and ability to pay debenture holders.Moneyweb recently revealed that the four board members collectively own 87.1% of the company and 91% of the voting rights and can therefore set and pay their own salaries.Nova also informed debenture holders last week that interest payments to debenture holders from November 1 have been suspended. This suspension should be seen in the context of the salaries of the four Nova directors.During a recent radio interview, Nova CEO Dominique Haese denied the board was overpaid and said the directors salaries are far less than comparable market salaries. In a subsequent communication to debenture holders she also proclaimed that salaries have a negligible impact on the company s operational performance . She added that if one looks at industry norms and market-related salaries, our salaries, if you do the calculation properly, is 70% of what an industry norm salary would be, taking all the risk, taking the responsibility of this group. Facts show the contrary.Comparison with industry normsThere are two ways to look at executive remuneration. The first is to compare the salaries of individual directors with industry averages. The second is to compare the combined salaries of all the executive directors with the combined salaries of executive directors of peer companies.In both cases, the Nova board compares exceptionally well to these industry norms, despite having a minuscule portfolio of assets to manage in comparison to the JSE-listed property companies. This is also despite Nova being a public company specially set up to rescue the R5 billion investments of 33 000 elderly Sharemax investors.Comparison of individual salariesLet&#8217;s first compare the salaries of the individual directors with the averages of JSE-listed property companies.An analysis of the directors remuneration in the 2015 and 2016 financial years appears below:Remuneration of Nova directors20162015TotalCash salariesTotalCash salariesDominique HaeseR5 276 724R4 151 724R4 491 527R3 666 527Rudi BadenhorstR4 518 801R3 393 801R3 882 044R3 057 044Dirk KoekemoerR4 596 630R3 471 630R3 879 171R3 054 171Connie MyburghR5 190 946R4 065 946R4 493 085R3 668 085R19 583 101 R15 083 101 R16 745 827 R13 445 827 Source: Nova annual financial statements&nbsp;In the table below, the average salaries of various C-suite directors of JSE listed property companies are listed. These salaries were captured by Profile Media during 2015 as a joint initiative with Moneyweb to calculate the average salaries of all JSE-listed companies. The salaries shown are average cash salaries of the executive directors of property companies that were disclosed in annual reports published in 2015. The averages exclude the salaries of executives of UK listed companies. (The 2015 salaries of the Nova board are used for the comparison as they correspond with the Profile Media data).Comparison of individual salaries with JSE listed averagesAverage SalaryCash salaryNova directors2015 Cash SalaryCEO, CE and Executive chairmenR4 042 391Haese (CEO)R3 666 527Myburgh (Chairman)R3 668 085Financial directorR2 010 364BadenhorstR3 057 044Chief operating officerR3 386 613KoekemoerR3 054 171AverageR3 146 456 R3 361 457&nbsp;This analysis shows there is a clear conflict between Haese s statement that directors receive 70% of the industry norm and the actual amounts. Some of the individual directors actually earn more than their JSE counterparts. This is despite the fact that the four directors manage properties valued at only R3.8 billion, of which R1.7 billion is locked into the half-built Villa. This is minuscule compared to the assets JSE-listed property companies manage. This also begs the question as to why there are four executive directors, who offer at least 32 hours of executive management a day, to manage this small portfolio. It may be a coincidence that the four each own around 21.8% of the company and collectively hold 91% of the voting rights.Comparison of salaries of all executive directors with industry peers.The second relevant comparison is between the combined salaries of Nova s executive directors and those of JSE-listed property companies. For this analysis, Nova&#8217;s 2016 salaries and bonus payments are used as Profile Media s information corresponds with Nova s financial year. All UK-listed companies were excluded from the analysis, as well as a few local companies whose total board remuneration was less than R500 000. However, the average includes cases where individual board members did not receive any remuneration.The Profile Media data shows that the four Nova directors combined salaries and bonuses of R15.1 million are extremely high. It is more than double the average of R6.1 million of the analysed companies and trumps the salaries of the executive management of blue chip companies such as Redefine, Resilient, Sirius and Arrowhead.&nbsp;Company NameCash Salaries of Executive Directors Tradehold Ltd.

The situation is even worse if it is compared to the company s cash flow. Over the same periods the cash salaries represent 16% and 17% of all the cash the company received from customers, ie the tenants in the various properties.This means that in the most recent financial year, the directors pocketed R17 of every R100 cash that was paid to the group, which has a significant impact on the company s cash flow. In fact, the company has not delivered a cash positive operating result since inception. In the 2016 financial year the company saw an operational outflow of R26 million and since the scheme s inception the total outflow amounts to R177 million.&nbsp;20152016Directors&#8217; cash salaries R13 445 827 R15 083 101Operating expenses R147 548 533 R137 315 546Salaries/expenses9%11%Cash received from customers R83 663 776R86 568 329% salaries/total cash receipts16%17%&nbsp;Inevitably, this cash flow position affects Nova s ability to pay debenture holders. It is, however, clear that directors pay themselves first, and then debenture holders. During 2015 and 2016 the directors cash salaries amounted to R28.5 million, while interest payments to 31 000 debenture holders amounted to R24.6 million. The Nova board also announced last week that it would stop interest payments to debenture holders.Response from Dominique Haese, CEO of Nova:Dear Mr van Niekerk,It is regrettable that our efforts in engaging Moneyweb openly, constructively and in a bona vide fashion has not been reciprocated.
