Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Bond routThis morning, the yield on the US 30-year Treasury rose to 3% for the first time since January, as the global bond rout that followed Donald Trump&#8217;s victory in the US presidential election continues apace. Long-dated bonds are also getting hit hardest in Europe, with Italy&#8217;s 50-year among the biggest losers. The jump in yields may be a message to the president-elect from the bond market on his plans to expand public debt to fund infrastructure investment, with the moves serving as a reminder of how &#8220;bond vigilantes&#8221; famously curtailed Bill Clinton&#8217;s spending plans during his first term. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has warned that Trump&#8217;s policies risk pushing the US economy into a period of stagflation. Trump&#8217;s teamThe president-elect may not be listening to those vigilantes at the moment, however, as he is busy putting together his White House team. Yesterday, he announced RNC chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, and former Breitbart News Executive chairman Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor. The two are expected to work together as &#8220;equal partners,&#8221; which is seen as an attempt by Trump to balance the expectations of his supporters and the needs of Washington. Over the weekend, the president-elect also watered down some of his more controversial campaign promises by saying that parts of the famous border wall with Mexico may be a fence, and that same-sex marriage is settled law. DealsThere are several multi-billion dollar deals in the news this morning. In Asia, Samsung Electronics Company agreed to buy Harman International Industries, a supplier of audio equipment to the automotive industry, for $8 billion, in a move that is seen as an attempt by the South Korean giant to shift away from its reliance on smartphones. In Europe, Novartis is said to be in talks to acquire US generic-drugs maker Amneal Pharmaceuticals in a deal which could value the closely-held company at as much as $8 billion. Siemens AG, meanwhile, agreed to buy software company Mentor Graphics Corporation for $4.5 billion, a premium of 21% on Friday&#8217;s closing price. Markets riseOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.4%, while Japan&#8217;s Topix index gained 1.6% after GDP data was better than forecast and the yen dropped to a five-month low. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.9% higher at 5:23am ET with banks accounting for most of the gains. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.4%. China data, Japan GDPThere were no signs of the Chinese economy losing steam in figures published overnight. Industrial production rose 6.1%, retail sales grew 10.1%, and fixed-asset investment added 8.3% as domestic drivers eased concerns over the possible impact of a Trump presidency on the economy. Japanese GDP surprised, expanding an annualised 2.2%, far ahead of expectations for 0.8%, with a rebound in exports leading the gains. Coming up later in the US are retail sales data due at 8:30am ET. 2016 Bloomberg
