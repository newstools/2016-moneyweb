ArcelorMittal South Africa on Tuesday reported a 19.1% drop in steel sales for the three months to end-September as its business was hit by weak demand and cheap imports.The steelmaker, a unit of ArcelorMittal, posted third quarter production of 1.12 million tonnes, a drop of 5.7% compared to the same period a year ago. Sales came in at 950,000 tonnes, compared to 1.17 million tonnes a year ago.&#8220;ArcelorMittal South Africa has been experiencing tough trading conditions mainly as a result of lower steel demand due to poor economic activity and ongoing imports,&#8221; chief executive Wim de Klerk said in a statement.Local steelmakers have been battling to survive, but last year got some relief when South Africa imposed a 10% tariff on imports.Data on Tuesday showed imports of cold-rolled steel from countries including China are hurting South African producers, after ArcelorMittal further requested that safeguard duties, also known as emergency tariffs, be imposed.&#8220;Having declined slightly from 2015 levels, imports are still high despite the 10% duties having been imposed,&#8221; the firm said.&#8220;The need for additional protection through safeguards is therefore imperative to address the surge in imports.&#8221;The company expects tough conditions to continue in the fourth quarter, but sees export sales increasing due to completed maintenance on its export-oriented Saldanha plant.
