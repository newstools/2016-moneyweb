JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s biggest consumer foods maker, Tiger Brands, on Wednesday reported a 19% rise in full-year profit after disposing of a loss-making Nigerian unit.Tiger Brands reported a 2% rise in headline earnings per share (EPS) of 2 130 cents on continuing operations but a 19% jump in headline EPS to 2 127 cents on operations including the Nigerian unit.Tiger Brands paid nearly $200 million for a 65.7% stake in Nigeria&#8217;s Dangote Flour Mills in 2012. But it failed to stem losses at the venture and sold it for just $1 in December last year.The maker of cereals, baby food and snacks, has said it is reviewing its strategy of expansion in Africa, which accounts for around 20% of its business, and has sold out of an Ethiopian venture in June.Trading conditions in key markets Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique are tough. Tiger Brands plans to push a wider range of its products into African markets, chief executive Lawrence MacDougall told reporters.Higher grain prices has pushed up inflation in South Africa to above 6% which will impact the first half of its 2017 financial year, the firm said.Other South African food producers, such as Pioneer Foods, said earlier this week that a severe drought and the weak economy will weigh on their performance.&#8220;We expect that to taper off in the second six months as we get the benefits, hopefully, of a much better crop in maize and sorghum in particular,&#8221; said chief financial officer Noel Doyle.he firm will give an update on its strategic review in six months, MacDougall said.
