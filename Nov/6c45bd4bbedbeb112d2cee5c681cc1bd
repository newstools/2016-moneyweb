Reynolds American Inc., the second-largest cigarette seller in the US, is seeking a higher price from British American Tobacco Plc after rejecting a $47 billion buyout offer as too low, according to people familiar with the matter.Both companies are in talks and BAT is willing to increase the price slightly, the people said, asking not to be named as the details aren t public. BAT, which already owns 42% of Reynolds, disclosed its proposal to acquire the rest of the company on Oct. 21.Spokesmen for BAT and Reynolds declined to comment.The transaction would let BAT overtake Philip Morris International Inc. as the world s largest publicly traded tobacco business. It also would give the London-based company a strong foothold in the US and access to Reynolds s leading electronic-cigarette position.BAT s unsolicited cash-and-stock offer of $56.50 a share represented about a 20 percent premium to Reynolds s closing price the previous day. Reynolds appointed a transaction committee to evaluate the proposal last month. 2016 Bloomberg
