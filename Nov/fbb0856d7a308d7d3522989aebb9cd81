JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand fell as much as 1.7% against the dollar on Wednesday, as heightened bets on a US interest rate hike next month lifted the greenback against emerging market currencies.Stocks eased with bullion producers on the backfoot as spot gold prices slid to nine-month lows.The rand stumbled to a session low of 14.3000/dollar, and was not far off that at 14.2700 by 1558 GMT, down 1.57% on the day.The rand was among the five worst performers in a basket of emerging market currencies monitored by Reuters, including the Hungarian forint, Colombian peso, Brazil&#8217;s real and the Russian rouble.&#8220;It&#8217;s basically the US dollar pushing stronger and US Treasuries spiking again,&#8221; Treasury One currency trader Andre Botha said.&#8220;People are expecting more interest rates hikes from the US so they are positioning themselves for that and that has been emerging markets negative.&#8221;South Africa&#8217;s own central bank is set to hold its repo rate at 7% on Thursday and through next year, according to a Reuters poll.On the stock market, mining shares led losses on the bourse as the gold spot price fell more than 2% and platinum shed 1.9% on a dollar rally sparked by strong US data.Impala Platinum shed 5.25% to R47.49, AngloGold Ashanti fell 3.65% to R152.01, Sibanye Gold dropped 2.47% to R31.21 and Gold Fields fell 2.40% to R43.13.Advancers included South Africa&#8217;s biggest consumer foods maker, Tiger Brands, which rose 2% to R392.24 after reporting a 19% rise in full-year profit.In fixed income, yields climbed higher across the curve, with the 10-year benchmark adding 2.5 basis points to close at 8.99%.
