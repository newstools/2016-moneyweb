JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s main opposition party said on Tuesday that police had promised to look into its accusations of corruption against President Jacob Zuma.The Democratic Alliance (DA) filed a criminal complaint against Zuma last week after an anti-corruption agency published a report listing allegations of influence-peddling in Zuma&#8217;s government.Zuma and his supporters have regularly dismissed accusations of corruption.&#8220;I can confirm today that the Hawks (police unit) will be investigating the DA&#8217;s corruption charges against Zuma relating to his role in state capture,&#8221; DA leader Mmusi Maimane said in an emailed statement.A Hawks spokesman was not immediately available for comment.The anti-graft agency&#8217;s report, released on November 2 and entitled &#8220;State of Capture&#8221;, stopped short of reaching conclusive findings against the president, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. But it has plunged Zuma into the latest crisis.Since coming to power in 2009, Zuma has survived a string of corruption scandals almost unscathed.
