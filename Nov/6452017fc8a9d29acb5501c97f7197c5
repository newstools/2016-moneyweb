Following in the footsteps of rivals Mediclinic International and Netcare, Life Healthcare (LHC) has, this week, announced a 553 million (R9,7 billion) acquisition of a 95% stake in UK group Alliance Medical.This move by LHC, not unlike many SA corporates, is in a bid to seek growth in foreign developing markets with a strong basket of currencies.Alliance Medical, a leading provider of complex molecular and diagnostic imaging services gives LHC access to the UK in which it is a partner with the NHS, Italy, Ireland and, to a lesser extent, to Northern Europe and Spain. SA s third largest private health-care provider already operates in Poland and India but this latest acquisition would, according to the company, increase the portion of revenue generated outside SA to 24% from 4%.An initial cash amount of 553 million will be paid and a deferred amount of up to 40 million (R0,7 billion) depending of Alliance s financial performance in the year-end March 2017. The selling shareholders are funds managed by M&amp;G Investments, Talbot Hughes Mckillop LLP and senior management of Alliance Medical. Senior management will reinvest to acquire a 5% stake in the company.The acquisition will be funded through a loan from Barclays plc and Rand Merchant Bank which, according to the company, will be temporary as LHC is planning a rights issue in the first quarter of 2017.Earlier this month Life Healthcare released its annual financial results for the year ended September 30. Against a backdrop of a weak macroeconomic environment in SA, the group increased revenue 12%, normalised EBITDA of 6.6% and headline earning per share of 7%, largely driven by volume growth. Yet even off this base, news of the acquisition saw the share price weaken close to levels last seen in January. Analysts attribute this market reaction to a number of things; Alliance Medical, a private and recently restructured company, was sold in a public bidding process suggesting that LHC bought the stake at a hefty multiple and the funding structure would entail a rights issue which would be dilutive on earnings.The acquisition is a category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE listing requirements. The effective date for the acquisition is expected to be November 21, 2016Greig is the Editor of DealMakers, SA s quarterly M&amp;A publication
