According to Statistics SA, mining production increased by 3,4% year-on-year (y/y) in September, mainly due to platinum group metals (10.5%, contributing 2.1 percentage points); iron ore (11.7%, contributing 2 percentage points); and coal (6.8%, contributing 1.6 percentage points).StatsSA said seasonally-adjusted mining production was up by 0.9% in September, following month-on-month changes of 2.3% in August 2016 and -2.4% in July 2016. Seasonally adjusted mining production was up by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, with iron ore the largest positive contributor (3.3 percentage points).Nedbank stated: &#8220;Mining production figures are volatile and hard to predict. However, the outlook for the sector remains poor on the back of low commodity prices, weak global and local demand, domestic infrastructure constraints and an uncertain policy environment, all factors that could limit production in the short to medium-term.&#8220;While mining production is important for growth in the economy, the Reserve Bank will remain focused on the rand and its impact on inflation when making decisions on interest rates. Given the recent uncertainty and volatility in the currency, the Reserve Bank is likely take a wait and see approach. Our forecast is for one more rate hike of 25 basis points early next year, with the risk that there could be more hikes in the event of a downgrade.&#8221;
