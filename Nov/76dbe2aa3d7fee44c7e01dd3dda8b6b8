MILAN/LONDON &#8211; European shares rose slightly on Tuesday, helped by a strong rebound in Italian banks, while reports of a improved takeover offer sent Swiss biotech Actelion rallying to a fresh all-time high.Italy&#8217;s bank index rose 4.1%, helped by a Reuters report that the European Central Bank stands ready to buy more Italian bonds if a referendum on Prime Minister Matteo Renzi&#8217;s constitutional reform this weekend rocks markets.The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended up 0.3% with gains in the broader European banking sector more than offsetting losses among mining and energy stocks.Italian lenders UBI, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit rose between 3.1% and 5.8%, while troubled lender Monte dei Paschi surged 17.5%, erasing losses seen on Monday which were due to worries over its ability to execute a vital 5 billion capital raising.The Italian banking index has fallen around 15% from its levels two weeks ago as investors reduced their exposure to the country&#8217;s assets before the December 4 referendum that could unseat Renzi. Renzi has said he would resign if the reform, as polls predict, is rejected.&#8220;Looking at today&#8217;s moves, it seems that some investors are considering the recent sell-off in Italian banks as overdone. It could be some last minute portfolio adjustments ahead of the referendum,&#8221; Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, said.&#8220;All those uncertainties related to the Italian referendum still exist. We will take a very cautious view on the country&#8217;s banking sector.&#8221;The chief executive of the Italian stock exchange said that big international investors were holding huge short positions on Italian assets.Later in the day, sentiment was boosted after Reuters reported the ECB was ready temporarily to step up purchases of Italian government bonds if the result of Sunday&#8217;s referendum sharply drives up the country&#8217;s borrowing costs. Italian banks have a big sovereign debt exposure.Actelion ended up 10%, reversing earlier losses after reports said US healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson is raising its offer for Swiss group in an attempt to win it over for a buyout.The European basic resources index fell 1.4%, the top sectoral decliner, as prices for lead and zinc fell more than 6% from the previous day&#8217;s multi-year peaks, as sliding oil prices and perceptions that a post-US election rally had become overstretched prompted selling.
