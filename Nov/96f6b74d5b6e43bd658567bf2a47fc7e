The South African education sector has been thrust into the spotlight in recent months, eliciting many questions, debates and varying opinions about the current state of the education sector within the country and the potential solutions to an ongoing crisis.It has been reported that South Africa has one of the highest rates of public investment in education in the world. Accounting for around 7% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 20% of total state expenditure, the government spends more on education than on any other sector. Yet this is currently not translating to tangible results.Amid all the current negative reports, there are opportunities presenting themselves within the sector to inspire greater outcomes for South Africa s youth.The primary education division is one of the hardest areas to innovate because young children need much more stability and hands-on guidance to aid their development, whereas in senior levels, children are able to self-study, which allows for more creativity in the tools they are exposed to within the classroom.SPARK Schools is dedicated to delivering accessible, high quality education by using a blended learning programme, which combines traditional classroom teaching and online learning, to individualise education for all students. We ve only just begun to shake things up in the way our education model works, but there is a need for an overhaul and renewed creativity, in order to work towards a system that benefits all our learners &#8211; countrywide.As state schools currently have the monopoly within the education system, more competition is needed to drive change. There&#8217;s a need for more entrepreneurs to get involved in this vital sector of the South African economy. It s not all about making money sometimes we have to forgo the easy sell to make a quick buck, and instead get innovative for the sake of our, and our children s, future.At SPARK Schools, school fees are benchmarked on what government s total cost to educate is and the business ensures that affordable means affordable to the country. In terms of cost, SPARK Schools are therefore more affordable than government schools and significantly more affordable than private schools, while in terms of quality, the SPARK Schools students are outperforming the national standard by at least one level.If parents were presented with more options to choose affordable, private education, as opposed to state school facilities, the sector would benefit overall. As in any industry where a monopoly is present, we tend to accept mediocrity for lack of other options available. But the minute there is new competition in the industry, we as consumers are able to choose options that suit us better, according to our own personal preferences. Competition also forces businesses and in this case, schools to aim higher and perform better.Ryan Harrison is co-founder of SPARK Schools
