Amidst worsening unemployment figures and sustained weak domestic demand, South Africa s fears of having its credit rating downgraded have intensified as it awaits Moody s rating review this week and S&amp;P s review next Friday.While a Moody s downgrade to South Africa s sovereign rating from its current rating of two levels above junk will be a disappointment, bringing us to only one notch away from sub-investment grade, a more significant indication will be whether it changes its current outlook from negative to stable, and what this will reveal about S&amp;P s rating decision next week.A ratings downgrade from Moody s would not come as a major surprise and doesn t pose as big a risk to the market as a downgrade by S&amp;P, which currently has South Africa s rating hanging on at only one level above junk status. If Moody s does decide to downgrade South Africa s credit rating, it would simply align their rating with that of S&amp;P and Fitch. However, in the event of such a downgrade, the important thing to observe will be whether Moody s revises its outlook from negative to stable. A stable outlook would indicate little to no intention to downgrade to junk any time soon, which will be viewed in a positive light by investors.Given our current economic environment, S&amp;P could downgrade South Africa s local rating; however, I do not expect them to downgrade the sovereign rating. If S&amp;P does leave our rating unchanged, this will buy South Africa little more time to get its house in order, implementing some much-needed reforms and consolidating the tentative progress that the SA economy is making. This begs the question: if S&amp;P doesn t downgrade us next week, will it happen at all? Rian le Roux is chief economist at Old Mutual Investment Group
