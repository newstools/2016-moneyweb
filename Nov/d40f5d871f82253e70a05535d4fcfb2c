&#8216;Trump tantrum&#8217; is to emerging-market assets what the &#8216;taper tantrum&#8217; was to emerging-market assets in 2013?So think Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Dirk Willer and Luis Costa, who argue that three-year old precedent suggests the selloff in emerging-market assets sparked by Donald Trump&#8217;s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election still has further to go.Both the 2013 taper tantrum and the 2016 Trump tantrum were driven by developments in U.S. interest rates, from which the analysts predict the appetite for emerging-market securities will again be unable to decouple. The key difference is in what&#8217;s selling off.First time around, expectations that the Federal Reserve would roll back its asset-purchase program hurt the typical high-yielders of Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. This time, the analysts say, &#8220;the composition in EM is quite different&#8221; even as investors price in higher rates off U.S. inflation and interest rate hikes from the Fed. &#8220;In rates, around half is done for U.S., and a bit less for EM,&#8221; the analysts write. Meanwhile, emerging-market currencies are &#8220;more than half done&#8221; when gauged against a taper tantrum-esque fall, and in emerging-market corporate bonds, &#8220;almost 1/2 of the taper tantrum sell-off is done.&#8221; Although they date the asset class&#8217;s slide to Sept. 30, when markets still ranked Trump as an improbable contender for the top spot in U.S. politics and it was the European Central Bank triggering market jitters, the rout is earning the moniker of &#8220;Trump tantrum&#8221; for this reason.Mexico and Asia have been the hardest hit, owing not to their foreign-currency liabilities but to the future president&#8217;s foreign-policy promises. &#8220;The underperformance of MXN and EM Asia is of course easily explained by the focus of President-elect Trump,&#8221; according to Citi. &#8220;We don t think Mexican rates can decouple, at least before an extraordinarily large rate hike out of Banxico,&#8221; say the analysts, who predict that the country&#8217;s credit-default swaps will continue to underperform.That means the selloff could prove even worse than in 2013, the analysts add, despite generally stronger fiscal positions in emerging-market economies.&#8221;While it is not clear how much of this protectionist part of President-elect Trump s platform can be implemented, it is clear that any move in this direction would add further impetus to inflation in the U.S., and would also redistribute growth from emerging markets to the U.S.,&#8221; they write.&#8220;This would suggest that EMFX can actually perform worse than in 2013, relative to U.S. assets. Furthermore, a potential trade war with China would undermine the commodity consumption by China and offset the positive impact from the U.S infrastructure spend.&#8221; 2016 Bloomberg L.P
