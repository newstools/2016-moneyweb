JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African opposition parties on Sunday urged President Jacob Zuma to report acts of corruption after the scandal-plagued leader said he knows who is stealing public funds.Since coming to power in 2009, Zuma has survived a string of corruption scandals almost unscathed, but this month the country&#8217;s anti-graft watchdog called for a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the ANC government.Zuma, in a bid to cement support in his home province of Kwazulu-Natal, on Friday told supporters in Zulu: &#8220;I know they are stealing. I&#8217;m just watching them. I know them,&#8221; local media reported.Both the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the nation&#8217;s two largest opposition parties, on Sunday called on Zuma to share the information he has with authorities.&#8220;President Jacob Zuma has a legal duty to report, to the law enforcement authorities, those who he knows to be engaged in criminal behaviour,&#8221; DA-leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement.The DA, which tabled a failed no-confidence motion against the president in Parliament last week, filed a criminal complaint against Zuma on Tuesday and will ask the police to also &#8220;investigate those people known by the President to be stealing&#8221;, Maimane said.Zuma must immediately report those stealing public funds, otherwise the EFF too will lodge a criminal complaint against the president, the EFF said in a statement.
