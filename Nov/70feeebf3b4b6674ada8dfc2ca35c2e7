JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand traded a tad firmer against the dollar on Monday, with dealers and analysts expecting muted trade ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s US election, whose outcome is seen as too close to call.At 0646 GMT, the rand was up 0.28% at 13.5675 to the dollar, after ending Friday&#8217;s session in New York at 13.6050.The currency was unmoved by central bank data showing South Africa&#8217;s net foreign reserves fell slightly to $41.799 billion in October from $41.953 billion the previous month.The rand held its own despite a newspaper report that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will be charged over a surveillance unit at the tax agency he once ran. The report comes six days after separate charges were dropped against Gordhan.The stock futures index was up 1%, suggesting the Johannesburg bourse will start the week on a strong note at 0700 GMT.Government bonds rose slightly in early trade, with the yield for 10-year debt down 3.5 basis points to 8.665% compared with Friday&#8217;s close.
