JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has signed wage agreements with the retail motor and retail fuel industries, it said on Monday, averting a potential strike that could have affected motorists during the Christmas holidays.The three-year agreements, signed with the Retail Motor Industry Organisation and the Fuel Retailers Association, will lift wages by between 7% and 10%. South African inflation currently stands at 6.1%.Workers who will be covered include fuel pump attendants, cashiers and employees in companies that sell and distribute automotive parts and services.South Africa&#8217;s unions have a reputation for militancy but several wage agreements have been reached this year without workers downing tools, including in a mining sector that has been shaken by violent labour unrest in recent years.
