Oil tumbled as a record increase in US crude stockpiles heightens the pressure on OPEC to reduce production.Crude stockpiles rose 14.4 million barrels, or 3.1%, last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. That s the biggest gain in agency data going back to 1982. A 2 million barrel increase was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Imports surged 28% to the highest in four years. Prices were down before the report s release on record OPEC output last month, which is complicating the group s effort to stabilise prices.Oil is continuing its retreat triggered by the failure last week of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on the member quotas required to implement an output deal reached in Algiers in September. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees little chance of an agreement at an official meeting of the group on November 30, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and OPEC s head remain confident of a deal.&#8220;Market conditions have deteriorated and we re back at $45,&#8221; said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC in New York. &#8220;This report increases the pressure on core OPEC members to come to an agreement on cuts by the time they meet on November 30.&#8221;West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped $1.42, or 3%, to $45.25 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract touched $44.96, the lowest since September 28. Total volume traded was 32% below the 100-day average.Brent for January settlement slipped $1.42, or 3%, to $46.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices reached $46.46, the lowest since September 28. The global benchmark crude traded at a 91 cent premium to January WTI.Bearish news &#8220;We re right back at the price we saw before the OPEC meeting in September,&#8221; said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist in Seattle at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $133 billion of assets. &#8220;There s been a lot of bullish speculation in the market and the news hasn t supported it. We re now going to test the bottom end of the recent range.&#8221;The gain left US crude supplies at 482.6 million in the week ended October 28, according to EIA data. Stockpiles are at the highest seasonal level in more than 20 years. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday that inventories rose by 9.3 million barrels last week.Crude imports rose 28% to 9 million barrels a day last week, the highest since September 2012. Production increased 0.2% to 8.5 million barrels a day.&#8220;We could fall further but I don t think it goes below $40,&#8221; said Joe Bozoyan, an equity portfolio manager who focuses on energy at John Hancock in Boston. &#8220;If prices go lower we will see a reversal in the rig count, which would hurt US production.&#8221;Libya, Nigeria and Iran &#8211; granted special status after OPEC members reached a supply deal September 28 in Algiers &#8211; pumped an extra 400,000 barrels a day in October, while Iraq, also demanding an exemption, added 50,000 barrels a day, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. 2016 Bloomberg L.P
