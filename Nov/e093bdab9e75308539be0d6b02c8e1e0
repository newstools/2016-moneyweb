PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s tax revenue increased by R83.7 billion to over a trillion rand, the tax collection agency said on Tuesday, as taxes on personal incomes compensated for a dip in company taxes.Total revenue grew to R1.07 trillion in the 2015/16 fiscal year, in-line with the South African Revenue Services&#8217; (SARS) target of around R1.07 billion.The revenue agency said tax on personal incomes, which accounts for the largest share of government revenue at 36.4%, increased 10% to R389.3 billion.&#8220;This was quite significant considering the low growth environment we are in,&#8221; said group executive at SARS Randall Carolissen.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country is forecast to grow at only 0.5% in 2016 by the Treasury, with major sectors of the economy contracting due to a lack of demand locally and abroad.In his October budget, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan predicted wider budget deficits up until 2018/19.Collections from corporate tax, while up from a year ago, shrunk as a total of revenue, growing to R193 billion from R185 billion in the previous year.&#8220;Companies are still carrying forward losses from the previous period,&#8221; Carolissen said, referring to last year.South Africa, hard-pressed to push up revenues and bring down spending, dodged downgrades of its debt to subinvestmnet grade by Fitch and Moody&#8217;s over the weekend.
