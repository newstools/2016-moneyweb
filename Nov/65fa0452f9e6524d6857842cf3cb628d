JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand recouped earlier losses against the dollar on Friday, with investors opting to head into the weekend on neutral ground ahead of next week&#8217;s domestic rates decision.Stocks were little changed as gold shares lost their shine. The benchmark Top-40 index ticked up just 0.1% to 42,216 points and the All-Share index inched up 0.02% to 50,626 points.The rand slumped to an 11-week low of 14.6500 earlier in Friday&#8217;s session, but recovered to 14.4300 by 1537 GMT, barely different from Thursday&#8217;s close at 14.4400.Traders and analysts say the rand is looking oversold after slumping from last week&#8217;s high of 13.1725 in an emerging market sell-off triggered by Donald Trump&#8217;s surprise victory in the US presidential election on November 8.&#8220;We still see rand weakness fading towards 14.0000. But markets are nervous, and patience is required,&#8221; Standard Bank said in a note.On the domestic front, next Thursday&#8217;s interest rates decision and a credit rating review from Moody&#8217;s the day after will also keep investors cautious, market watchers said.Gold stocks were the weakest performers on South Africa&#8217;s stock market, with Harmony Gold falling 6.05% to 34.76, while Anglo Gold Ashanti declined 3.93% to 163.73 and Sibanye Gold slipped 3.42% to 33.29 rand.Gold touched its lowest since late May on Friday as the dollar surged to a near 14-year peak on expectations for a US rate hike next month and higher fiscal spending from Trump&#8217;s administration, which takes office on January 20.&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing commodity prices coming under pressure,&#8221; said BP Bernstein trader Vasili Tirasis. &#8220;Things are a bit volatile at the moment, market waiting to get some direction.&#8221;Trading was below average, with more than 220 million shares changing hands, compared with last year&#8217;s daily average of 296 million.Government bonds closed slightly firmer on Friday, and the yield for the 10-year instrument benchmark dipped 2 basis points to 8.975%.
