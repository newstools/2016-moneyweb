Oil losses reversed as global markets weighed the implications of Republican Donald Trump s election as the 45th US president.Futures rose 1.5% in New York as equities climbed, after falling as much as 4.3% earlier. Turbulence in financial markets calmed and a knee-jerk selloff of risky assets abated as Trump, 70, promised to try to unite America s divided political factions after his victory over Hillary Clinton.&#8220;The oil market is following stocks,&#8221; said Bill O Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $5.2 billion. &#8220;We re getting a relief rally pretty much on nothing. The fundamentals are not that bullish.&#8221;The result nonetheless rattled markets that had banked on a continuation of economic and trade policies under a Democrat president. Most polls had shown Clinton ahead of Trump going into the vote and websites that took bets on the victor had put her odds of winning at 80% or more.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery rose 68 cents to $45.66 a barrel at 12:17 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after dropping as much as $1.91 to $43.07. Total volume traded was more than double the 100-day average.Brent for January settlement climbed 61 cents, or 1.3%, to $46.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a 32-cent premium to WTI for January delivery.Market reversal &#8220;This is quite a reversal from midnight last night,&#8221; said Matt Sallee, who helps manage $15 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kansas. &#8220;We re still coming to grips with the implications of the election. A consensus may be forming that fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and a loose monetary policy will be good for growth.&#8221;The S&amp;P 500 Index climbed for a third day. The S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Production Select Industry index, up 3.4% at 12:16 p.m., was set for the biggest increase since September 28.&#8220;The market is in wait-and-see mode,&#8221; said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. &#8220;We can look forward to a lot of volatility as the policies and plans of the Trump administration are formulated.&#8221;Trump exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the president-elect and the Republicans also retained control of Congress. Trump has pledged to clamp down on immigration to the US and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico.Formulating policies &#8220;I don t think President Trump will have a big impact on oil demand or output,&#8221; said Mike Wittner, head of oil-market research at Societe Generale SA in New York. &#8220;He s made statements, but we haven t seen any thought-out policies. We will have to wait for him to get a team in place and come up with policies.&#8221;In the longer term, the reaction in oil markets to the election result would likely take a back seat to questions over whether OPEC will be able to complete a deal to restrain output at its late-November meeting in Vienna.US crude stockpiles rose 2.43 million barrels to 485 million last week, Energy Information Administration data showed Wednesday. A 2 million-barrel gain was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 4.4 million increase was reported Tuesday by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.&#8220;The election doesn t impact how much oil is being pumped or how much gasoline is being used,&#8221; said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. &#8220;After the big move overnight it s back to the fundamentals.&#8221;Oil retreated below $45 a barrel following the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries failure to agree on output quotas for member countries on October 28. The group must reach a consensus before finalising its September deal to cut production. OPEC s chief warned of prolonged market instability if there is no agreement to limit supply.Other raw materials and the companies that produce them were whipsawed by Trump s shock victory. Agricultural commodities declined while industrial metals rebounded from earlier losses and gold surged with haven assets.In other oil market news, militants blew up the Forcados oil pipeline in Nigeria, Niger Delta Avengers spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo wrote on Twitter.
