JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar on Wednesday, mainly reflecting broad dollar gains as investors increasingly price in a US rate hike next month, traders and analysts said.Stocks rose, however, as buyers piled back into the oversold retail sector. The benchmark Top-40 index rose 1.17% to 43,592 points while the All-Share index added 1.16% to 50,005 points.The rand hit a session low of 14.3850 per dollar before clawing its way back to 14.3125 by 1552 GMT, still down 0.93% from Tuesday&#8217;s New York close of 14.1800.&#8220;It&#8217;s just a lot of dollar strength at the moment. As we head towards December everyone&#8217;s expecting a US rate hike to happen. I think it&#8217;s been priced in about 90% now,&#8221; Treasury One dealer Phillip Pearce said.&#8220;We&#8217;ve found a whole new range now between 14.1000 and 14.5000 and we&#8217;re going to be bouncing between that until we have clear guidance after the (Federal Reserve) meeting.&#8221;On the bourse, the retail index climbed 3.11% after official data showed a 1.4% year-on-year rise in retail sales.&#8220;They are looking a bit oversold at the moment and there&#8217;s a lot of hope that we are close to the top of the interest rate cycle,&#8221; Standard Bank Stockbroking trader Rudi van der Merwe said.No-frills retailer Mr Price recouped some of its heavy losses from the previous session, adding 5.89% to R141.89, while The Foschini Group gained 2.88% to R135.65 and Truworths International was up 3.41% to R68.50.Grocery retailer Spar Group rose 3.94% to R182 after reporting a 22.1% rise in full-year profit.Trading was below average, with slightly more than 250 million shares changing hands, compared with last year&#8217;s daily average of 296 million.Government bonds edged higher across the curve, and the yield for 10-year debt dipped 4 basis points to 9.015%.
