JOHANNESBURG The introduction of a carbon tax is expected to lead to a reduction in the annual average growth rate of the economy of 0.05 to 0.15 percentage points compared to a business-as-usual scenario, a new study shows. In other words, instead of the economy growing at 3.5% per year, it grows at 3.3% to 3.4% per year. This means that GDP in 2035 could be between 1% and 3% lower than in a situation in which the carbon tax is not introduced, it says.According to the research, which was commissioned by National Treasury, the carbon tax would have a similar modest impact even if the economy grew at a lower medium-term growth rate of 2.4% per annum.John Ward, managing director of Vivid Economics who prepared the report, says the results suggest that there is a very modest impact expected from the carbon tax on the overall economy in a situation where the revenues are returned to the economy.It is estimated that the carbon tax would initially add roughly R10 billion a year to state coffers, although a significant amount of the revenues would be recycled through credits against the electricity levy and other measures.The net revenue for the fiscus is close to zero in the initial phases, Cecil Morden, chief director for economic tax analysis at National Treasury, says.The carbon tax was proposed to come into effect on January 1 next year, but consultation has been on-going amid fears that it could cripple carbon intensive industries that are already under pressure and as the Davis Tax Committee s proposals are considered.Although Treasury has stressed that the tax is meant to change behaviour, there are concerns that the tax will ultimately be a money-spinner for government, particularly in an environment where it is under pressure to collect additional tax revenues. In his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said the carbon tax bill would be dealt with next year.The modeling suggests that the carbon tax would lead to an estimated decrease in emissions of 13% to 14.5% by 2025 and 26% to 33% by 2035. This suggests that the policy would make an important contribution towards reaching the 42% reduction by 2025 target, but would need to be complemented by additional policies if this target is to be met. Alternatively, a higher carbon tax rate than currently envisaged could be adopted, the report notes.The modeling indicates that in 2035, the output from the nuclear, wind, hydro, gas, solar photovoltaic and other generation sectors could be more than 200% greater than without a carbon tax. At the same time, coal generation, becomes much less cost-competitive and, as a result, its output is 46% lower in 2035 than it would be without the tax. The petroleum, refining, other manufacturing, coke production and electricity supply sectors are also expected to see a substantial decline in output relative to a business-as-usual scenario although all these sectors are projected to grow in absolute terms between 2014 and 2035, even if the tax is introduced.While the research proposes that competitiveness concerns are overstated, coke oven and iron and steel sectors are projected to see notable declines in exports (relative to a situation where no tax is introduced), although in the case of iron and steel, exports continue to grow albeit at a lower rate.Andrew Partridge, senior economist at the Department of Agriculture in the Western Cape Government, says without taking corrective measures into account, the severity of the impact is not just a matter of carbon intensity, but also of energy intensity.During the proposed first phase, National Treasury has made a commitment that the electricity price would not increase as a result of the tax, Morden adds.Ward says there are some important benefits from a carbon tax that aren t modeled in the paper in particular reduced congestion, improved health and the impact this would have on productivity. There is a lot of very good research out there from people like the IMF who have suggested that would in itself justify a carbon tax of the size that we see proposed in South Africa even before we begin to worry about climate change impacts, he says.Kyle Mandy, PwC tax policy leader, says the results of the modeling is less concerning than many commentators may have anticipated, but would require more careful analysis.The key is really what is done with the revenues, he says. If it is simply used as a revenue raising tool, which is my primary concern, then it is going to be more damaging. Even if the carbon tax is used as an alternative to raising other taxes, the question still arises what the damage from extracting more taxes out of the economy is going to be and if the carbon tax would be more damaging than other taxes, he says.Although even the conservative growth assumptions used in the modeling is still ambitious in light of expectations that the economy will only grow 0.5% this year, Mandy says the modeling stretches over a period up to 2035. The estimates are in line with the long-term economic growth performance of South Africa as well as its growth potential.Although the modeling indicates a relatively small economic impact whether from a GDP or an employment point of view in light of current circumstances, the question can be asked if South Africa can afford any negative consequences from the introduction of a carbon tax, he adds.Sustainability consultancy, FutureWorks and the University of Pretoria, conducted the research, titled Modeling the Impact on South Africa s Economy of Introducing a Carbon Tax.
