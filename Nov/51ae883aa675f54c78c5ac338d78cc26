Zimbabwean national power company ZESA Holding&#8217;s loss will widen to $224 million this year from $112 million in 2015 due to higher electricity imports and because it is selling power at below cost, the chief executive said on Monday.The southern African nation&#8217;s economy is struggling from a devastating drought and crippling cash shortages and consumers are struggling to pay utility bills such as power and water.ZESA Holdings chief executive Josh Chifamba said the power company would spend $160 million this year on imports from South Africa&#8217;s Eskom and Mozambique&#8217;s Hydro Cahora Bassa, compared to $28 million last year, putting a squeeze on ZESA&#8217;s finances.ZESA is also buying electricity from a local diesel plant at 15 cents per kilowatt-hour, but sells the power at an average 9.86 cents to domestic consumers, Chifamba said.&#8220;We are actually haemorrhaging as it is. We are selling power at below cost,&#8221; Chifamba told a committee of parliament.Zimbabwe&#8217;s energy regulator in July rejected an application by ZESA&#8217;s subsidiary to raise electricity tariffs by nearly 50%, saying it would hurt the economy.ZESA has set provisions for bad debts at $65 million this year, which would worsen the company&#8217;s financial position.Zimbabwe has approved a raft of power projects in the last two years that would see the country produce excess electricity but it is struggling to raise money to get start the projects.
