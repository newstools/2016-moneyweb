JOHANNESBURG Past performance is not an indication of future performance, the disclaimer warns.And yet, an analysis by one of South Africa s largest unit trust managers demonstrates how investment flows have followed performance, particularly over the last two years.The chart below shows the rolling one-year returns of the Allan Gray Balanced Fund (the red line) as well as the rolling one-year alpha (outperformance relative to its benchmark) over a period of ten years. The shaded grey area is an indication of net intermediated inflows or outflows (flows via an intermediary like a financial advisor).Source: Allan GrayCarl Lategan, head of IFA distribution at Allan Gray, says there is a clear correlation between performance and flows.This has been particularly prevalent during the last two years (depicted by the white highlighted block in the chart).As the fund s performance has improved, inflows followed, whereas a period of relative underperformance was generally followed by outflows, with roughly a six-month lag between performance and flows.This trend was particularly prevalent during the last two years, which is depicted in the graph below (an enlarged image of the white block in the top graph).Source: Allan GrayLategan says as performance faded (actual performance as well as performance relative to peers) investors withdrew assets from the fund.Often clients divest in the belief that they could get better returns by investing in recent outperformers.Ultimately when performance was as its worst, people have tended to exit the fund and invested elsewhere.After a period of relative outperformance, funds have started to come back into the fund over the last few months.The impact on returnsHad a client invested at a time when the fund experienced peak inflows (point A on the graph) and disinvested at B (when net outflows were at a maximum) the return over a one-year period would have been 3.6%.Had the client stuck out the period of underperformance and remained invested from point A to C, the cumulative return over the two-year period would have been 20%, while the return during the recovery period from B to C would have been 15.7%Ultimately the difference in return between an investor who stayed in the fund from point A to C and someone who only remained invested from point A to B would be roughly 6%.Compounding a return of 6% over a long period of time would make a meaningful difference in the client s wealth creation.Lategan says if investors have a diversified portfolio with good managers and funds, and they have done their homework, it is unwise to switch funds during periods when performance is under pressure. Most value is destroyed by trying to time the market buying high and selling low. * The journalist is an investor in Allan Gray s Balanced Fund.
