JOHANNESBURG &#8211; A major investor in the parent company of South Africa&#8217;s Cell C has launched a court challenge aimed at stopping the sale of a 45% stake in the mobile phone operator to Blue Label Telecoms, according to court papers seen by Reuters on Thursday.CellSAF holds a 25% stake in 3C Telecommunications, which in turn owns Cell C, South Africa&#8217;s third-largest mobile phone operator.CellSAF said in the court papers it was not informed about the sale of the stake in Cell C to Blue Label and the transaction &#8220;unfairly disregards the interests of CellSAF.&#8221;Blue Label, the largest distributor of pre-paid airtime and data in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country, said in October it would pay R5.5 billion ($400 million) for a 45% stake in debt-laden Cell C.Blue Label shares closed down 2.34% to R18.82.Blue Label spokesman Michael Campbell said he could not comment as the firm had not received a court summons from CellSAF. 3C could not immediately be reached for comment.The deal, which is part of Cell C&#8217;s efforts to reduce its debt of around R20 billion, would dilute CellSAF&#8217;s indirect interest in the mobile firm from 25% to 7.5%, according to the court papers.($1 = R14.1900)
