JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s borrowing costs would likely &#8220;double or triple&#8221; if ratings agencies downgraded the country&#8217;s debt to subinvestment grade in the coming months, Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said on Tuesday.Jonas said debt servicing costs were the highest growing item in October&#8217;s medium-term budget and along with low growth would force government to cut welfare spending.Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s and Fitch both rate South Africa&#8217;s debt on the lowest investment grade level and are due to give their next reviews in December.
