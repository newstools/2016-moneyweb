JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Nampak reported a 48% drop in full-year profit due to foreign exchange losses in Nigeria and Angola, the packaging firm said on Monday.Nampak said diluted headline EPS totalled 107.6 cents in the year end-September compared with 208.2 cents a year earlier.&#8220;Abnormal&#8221; foreign exchange losses cost the firm around R681 million ($48 million) as Angola&#8217;s kwanza currency fell 23% and Nigeria&#8217;s naira lost 58% of its value, Nampak said.&#8220;The economic environment in Angola and Nigeria was very challenging; the lack of availability of US dollars (USD) rendered the timing and quantum of conversion from in country currencies to USD uncertain and sporadic,&#8221; chief executive Andr de Ruyter said in a statement.No dividend declared to conserve cash, compared with 134 cents last year.The firm increased sales 11% to R19.1 billion on good trading in Nigeria and Zimbabwe and as its glass unit returned to profit.Headline EPS is the main profit measure in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.Shares in Nampak were down 0.5% at R17.50 by 1241 GMT, while the JSE All-share index was flat.($1 = R14.1972)
