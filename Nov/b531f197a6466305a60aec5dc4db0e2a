The newly-operational Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Commission, led by Acting Commissioner Zodwa Ntuli, has been on a stakeholder roadshow this year. The roadshow has shared important information about how B-BBEE will be measured and highlighted the issues that the commission will be clamping down on, with associated penalties and implications for non-compliance. The revised Codes of Good Practice, Sector Codes and Procurement guidelines have collectively resulted in a revised scorecard with higher requirements to achieve specific contributor level recognition. Against this background, the Commission is seeking to ensure that the transformation agenda continues to gain momentum and is supported by a formal ability to research, monitor and promote adherence by Corporate SA.Whilst the commission s ambit is broad in terms of compliance, with all categories contained within the relevant scorecards, there appears a particular emphasis in the way it operates on ensuring that the ownership element is being properly, adequately and sustainably addressed. Bravura Capital attended the commission s briefing sessions and cover below some of the relevant B-BBEE ownership considerations.Context of the commissionThe commission takes, as its departure point, the fundamental aims and objectives of the transformation agenda, as underpinned by the policy and initiative framework that has, at its foundation, the B-BBEE Act. These initiatives aim to:Ownership as a core objectiveThe requirement for an ownership transaction has been identified as one of three priority elements under the Revised Codes of Good Practice. At its core, the objective is to change ownership patterns within the economy, with a targeted minimum of 25,1% ownership although there are specific sectors and industries where this requirement is actually higher. In addition, the procurement element of the scorecard also makes provision for additional points to be awarded to suppliers who meet higher ownership requirements up to and including being 51% black owned.There are three critical measures to ascertain ownership:Net equityIt is important to focus on ensuring all three of these characteristics are met, but it is the &#8216;net equity&#8217; requirement that has important implications for the way deals are structured and implemented. Net Equity is essentially the difference between the value of the shareholding in the hands of black people and the value of any encumbrance on that shareholding incurred in its acquisition. Historically, deals that sold stakes to black people were often associated with high levels of indebtedness. Whilst these transactions might meet the first two criteria, there is no effective value transfer unless the growth in the value of the stake materially outstrips that of the debt whether through growth in value or the ability to pay down the associated debt.The net equity concept formalises this expectation as a requirement, and evidence of this equity gap growing through the life cycle of an empowerment transaction is needed to ensure appropriate points are scored. This equity gap has to grow exponentially through the lifetime of the transaction and would appear potentially difficult to guarantee under traditional funding structures, without the need for meaningful discounts. Even then, the cycle of business performance might still endanger the maximisation of the ownership points if the growth in value slows down the line.Beneficiaries of empowermentIn addition, it remains important to focus on the mix and nature of the targeted beneficiaries of empowerment transactions. There will still be the need to consider the relevance of strategic partners, but also a broader beneficiary base which ensures maximum adherence of a transaction to the requirements of the ownership scorecard, including broad-based beneficiaries and new entrants.There are three focus areas: skills development, enterprise development and research &amp; development. The duration of the programme should be linked to the investment amount, and Ministerial approval is required.In Bravura s experience, the Equity Equivalent Programme alternative is extremely inflexible and unyielding, particularly given the limitations in terms of the length of the transactions, the cost and the need to reach agreement with the relevant ministries to ensure it is recognised as a compliant scheme.The Role of the B-BBEE CommissionThe Government Gazette No 40053 Volume 612 of 2016, published on June 6 2016, sets out the functions of the commission:Importantly, a key function of the commission will be the registration of new major B-BBEE transactions which will effectively allow the commission to vet the details of the transaction to ensure it demonstrates the required criteria in order to be an effective transaction. Whilst the nature of the assessment and the size thresholds requiring registration have not been confirmed, this clearly expresses a more pro-active intent on the part of the Department of Trade and Industry to monitor transactions to ensure they meet with the spirit of the B-BBEE framework, with substance over form an important consideration.In addition, certain entities, including all JSE Listed Companies, will be required to submit a compliance report to the commission on an annual basis. The areas that the commission is likely to focus on include, but are not limited to, overly complex structures, lack of minority rights protection, corporate governance failures and third party facilitation.A key area to take note of is the emphasis that the commission has placed on fronting practices. Over the past six months, complaints received by the commission have been largely attributed to fronting, and the commission has stressed that it will be focusing on all these practices that not only include issues around ownership, but which could impact all the elements of the B-BBEE Scorecard.Indicators of fronting in ownership transactions are:Further, the commission has in place a defined complaints procedure which enables the reporting and investigation of suspected contraventions of the requirements set out. Such investigation processes can be lengthy and have severe penalties for transgressions.ConclusionIt is important for companies to scrutinise their current B-BBEE structures and consider addressing anything that is inconsistent with scorecard requirements, in order to avoid serious potential penalties.The stakes for new B-BBEE transactions are meaningfully higher and the need to effectively structure and implement transactions that are fully compliant and that will meet with the approval of the commission is obvious. This requires a clear and detailed understanding of the provisions of the relevant codes and policy documentation, and a proactive approach to designing and engaging with structures that both meet the requirements but also ensure that companies remain able to grow and thrive.Jones is corporate finance principal at Bravura.(This article first appeared in DealMakers, SA s quarterly M&amp;A magazine)
