Africa&#8217;s biggest company by market value, Naspers, reported a jump in half-year profit on Friday, boosted by its internet businesses that include a major stake in China&#8217;s Tencent Holdings.Cape Town-based Naspers, which owns about a third of China&#8217;s biggest social network and online entertainment firm, said core headline earnings totalled $914 million, or 212 cents per share, compared with $696 million, or 169 cents per share, a year earlier.Core headline earnings per share (EPS) is Naspers&#8217; main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items.Founded in 1915 as Nasionale Pers, or National Press, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into a $64 billion Internet powerhouse by focusing on e-commerce platforms such as auction sites and classified ads in emerging markets.Sales rose 16% to $6.8 billion as a one-third rise in revenue from e-commerce businesses offset falling sales at payTV and media units.Shares in the company closed 1.26% higher at R2,092, outpacing a 0.29% gain in Johannesburg&#8217;s JSE Top-40 index.
