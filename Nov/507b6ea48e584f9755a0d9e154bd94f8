JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s national oil company PetroSA on Friday posted a narrower full-year loss after posting a record loss a year ago, but warned that weak commodity prices were still a threat to its business.Many of South Africa&#8217;s 300-odd state-owned companies, including South African Airways are a drain on the government&#8217;s purse and a team commissioned by President Jacob Zuma to review them has recommended that some companies should be sold.The petroleum, oil and gas company said in a statement it posted a net loss of R449 million ($31 million) for the 2015/2016 financial year which ended in March versus a R14.6 billion loss previously &#8211; the biggest of any state-owned firm since 1994.PetroSA also said it plans to launch a turnaround strategy aimed at securing its long-term financial viability.&#8220;We are not out of the woods yet,&#8221; said chief executive officer Siphamandla Mthethwa, referring to global economic headwinds that could affect the business in the current year.Oil prices have fallen the last three days, but Brent is still up 6% from a three-month low hit last Friday.Revenue fell by 13% to R15.7 billion, while core profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation) declined by 3% to R2.1 billion, the firm said.PetroSA&#8217;s huge loss in the last financial year was caused by the sharp drop in oil prices and the weak performance of its gas fields Ikhwezi project, which was expected to deliver 242 Billion Cubic Feet (BCF) of commercial gas reserves for PetroSA&#8217;s Mossel Bay gas-to-liquid refinery.But the project had only delivered 25 BCF of commercial gas reserves from three wells out of five.($1 = R14.6015)
