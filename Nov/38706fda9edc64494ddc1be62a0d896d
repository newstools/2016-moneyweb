The chairman led negotiations with the country s authorities, eventually agreeing to pay about $1 billion, and hired Shuter as his successor. As CEO for almost nine years until 2011, he transformed MTN from a small South African wireless carrier into a telecommunications giant with customers in 22 countries.The chairman sold about 1.08 million shares at R113.86 each. He had just over 2 million shares at the end of 2015, according to MTN s annual report.MTN shares declined 0.6% to R113.20 by the close in Johannesburg, extending the year s decline to 15%.
