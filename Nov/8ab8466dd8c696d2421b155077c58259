JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s big four banks will see a rise in problem loans in the next 12 to 18 months as the economy struggles to grow, but this poses only a moderate risk to profits, ratings agency Moody&#8217;s said on Tuesday.Sluggish economic growth, forecast by the government to average 0.5% this year, will pose challenges for FirstRand, Standard Bank, Barclays Africa Group and Nedbank.&#8220;The subdued South African economy will restrain their lending growth and make it harder for borrowers, especially households, to service their debt repayments,&#8221; said a Moody&#8217;s vice president Nondas Nicolaides.Rising interest rates and inflation above the central bank&#8217;s target of 6% will also expose banks to higher default risks, the agency said.Moody&#8217;s said it expects non-performing loans ratios in the banking sector to increase to around 4% by end-2017 from 3.2% in June 2016, which will dampen profitability as it leads to higher provisioning costs.&#8220;FirstRand Bank is best-placed to manage the weak operating environment among its local peer banks,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said.&#8220;FirstRand also has the highest overall provisioning coverage for non-performing loans, the highest capital base and strong earnings generation.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s government last month lowered its GDP growth forecast for this year from 0.9% expected in February, and cut its estimate for 2017 to 1.3% from 1.7% previously.
