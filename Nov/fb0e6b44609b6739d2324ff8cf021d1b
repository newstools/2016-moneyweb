MILAN &#8211; Italian shares underperformed positive European markets on Thursday, as the country&#8217;s bank stocks slumped to five-week lows on jitters over next month&#8217;s constitutional reform referendum.A bounce in basic resources and energy stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise 0.6%, making up for losses seen in the previous session, but Milan&#8217;s blue-chip FTSE MIB index ended flat.Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Thursday he would not take part in any efforts to form a temporary government if he loses the December 4 vote, bolstering expectations he could quit. Polls suggest Renzi will lose.&#8220;We have Renzi now saying he won&#8217;t head up a technocratic government in the event he loses the vote so it&#8217;s turned into a straight referendum on the prime minister and his government,&#8221; ETX Capital Markets Analyst Neil Wilson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be that much harder to fix Italian banks if he loses and it looks like it&#8217;s going that way.&#8221;Italy&#8217;s lenders UniCredit and Banco Popolare fell 5.6 and 4.8% respectively and were among the biggest losers on the STOXX index.

The index was the biggest sectoral gainer on the day.The Energy index rose 1% as expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production boosted crude prices.Among other outstanding gainers, South African financial services group Investec climbed 8.5% to a six-month high after reporting a jump in half-year profit, buoyed by a strong showing at its asset management and wealth arms.Among top losers, Ahold Delhaize fell 3.7% after the supermarket operator missed expectations for third-quarter results due to weakness at its US grocery chains.Britain&#8217;s Royal Mail slumped 7%, the biggest STOXX loser.
