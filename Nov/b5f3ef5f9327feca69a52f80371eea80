NAIROBI &#8211; Kenya&#8217;s economy is likely to expand by just over 6% next year, down from an initial forecast of 6.5%, mainly because of slowing private-sector credit growth, a senior Treasury official said on Wednesday.&#8220;We don&#8217;t see credit growth affecting growth especially for 2016. We have moderated our growth in 2017 to slightly over 6%. Before we were very optimistic it would get to 6.5%,&#8221; Geoffrey Mwau, the director general of fiscal and economic affairs, told Reuters.
