South Africa s chief prosecutor, Shaun Abrahams, has been asked to explain why he shouldn t be suspended, weeks after announcing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will be charged with fraud and then withdrawing the case.The letter from President Jacob Zuma follows a court application from Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation to suspend Abrahams and two other prosecutors over the way they conducted the matter against the finance minister. Gordhan claimed the charges were politically motivated. The president has requested the three advocates to make written representations to him, as to why they should not be placed on suspension and whether to hold an inquiry into their fitness to hold office, the presidency said in a e-mailed statement on Tuesday.The investigation and possible charges against Gordhan for approving a pension payout of a former revenue service colleague knocked the rand and bonds, adding to political instability in Africa s most-industrialized economy. Abrahams dropped the charges on October 31, saying the case wasn t likely to be successful in court, after a campaign to support Gordhan by some members of the ruling African National Congress, opposition parties and other groups.The finance minister is still under investigation for overseeing the setting up of an allegedly covert surveillance unit when he headed the tax agency a decade ago. Abrahams, who must give reasons by November 28 why he shouldn t be suspended, clashed with Berning Ntlemeza, the head of the Hawks police unit that investigated the case about the decision to drop the charges against Gordhan.Ntlemeza accused Abrahams of buckling to pressure from politicians, civil-society groups and the media, while the prosecutions head accused the police of an incomplete probe into the matter, Johannesburg-based Business Day reported, citing letters between the two officials. 2016 Bloomberg
