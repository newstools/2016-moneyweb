JOHANNESBURG Astoria s share price jumped almost 10% to R10.42 on Tuesday, following a decision to terminate a controversial share option scheme for executive directors.The AltX-listed investment company s share price eventually closed 5.27% higher at R9.99.Investors lambasted the Mauritian-based firm, whose investments are run by Anchor Capital, when it announced the approval of the scheme in September. The purpose of the scheme was to attract, reward and retain executive directors.Moneyweb reported earlier that several of its investors voiced their concern about the potential dilution shareholders could face if a significant chunk of shares were issued. Some argued there was no reason for management to be incentivised if the core investment function of the company was outsourced.Although no options were issued, the announcement came at a time when Astoria s share price was down roughly 24% since it listed at R14.49 in November last year.Peter Armitage, non-executive director of Astoria, says the scheme was put in place with a view to incentivise the company s two executive directors, but no options had been issued.During a recent investor road show investors argued that the incentive scheme was inappropriate given the structure of the business. Shareholders felt that Anchor Capital performed the asset management function and the CEO and CFO of Astoria the only two employees that would have been eligible for the scheme didn t need to be incentivised as they performed a governance role and ran the operations.The board listened to these concerns and terminated the scheme, Armitage says.In an announcement on the JSE s news service Astoria stressed that no share options, share appreciation rights, performance shares or any other benefits related to the scheme were outstanding at the date of termination.It said the board was considering the merits of a share repurchase and would announce further details in due course.When a share is trading at a significant discount to its net asset value, one option to add value to shareholders is to buy back shares.The Mauritian listings rules are a lot more complex than the JSE rules and this is the only reason it hasn t been done, Armitage says.Astoria has a primary listing on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius and a secondary listing on the AltX.Amelia Morgenrood, portfolio manager at PSG, says the termination of the scheme illustrates that shareholders voices are heard.Locally, shareholders have been relatively quiet in the past. Recent lobbying shows that South Africa follows global trends towards greater shareholder activism. This is a positive sign, she says.The approval of the scheme came at a time of relative rand strength and pressure on Astoria s share price. Shareholders may feel differently about incentivising executive directors once meaningful value has been created, Morgenrood says.The company attracted significant interest during its listing last year, as it effectively offered investors an opportunity to invest in a broader portfolio of offshore equities, private equity assets and niche funds through a locally listed share. Astoria will continue with its stated objective of achieving strong USD capital appreciation over the medium-to-long-term by investing in global, equity-dominated holdings of primarily direct, high-quality listed businesses, the company said on Tuesday.
