Now that property buyers cannot be liable for a seller s historical municipal debt, many relieved prospective homebuyers and business owners may be looking for ways to protect themselves from being slapped with a massive bill.The constitutionality of the entrenched practice by municipalities, mainly the City of Tshwane and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality, of charging new owners with old debt was recently clarified by the High Court in Pretoria in a ground-breaking judgement.Municipalities would muscle in on new owners by refusing to supply services including electricity, water, and waste removal until the outstanding debt was paid.In some cases, the debt dated up to 30 years.The court case, presided by Judge Dawie Fourie, includes five separate applications that involve situations in which the transfer of properties occurred after receiving a municipal clearance certificate while all properties had historical debt.In one case, Chantel Jordaan purchased a property at an auction in 2013 and was only responsible for paying municipal services in order to obtain a clearance certificate as stipulated in section 118 of the Municipal Systems Act.The Tshwane municipality initially claimed R88 000 from Jordaan, who only paid R35 000 after audit firm New Ventures Consultancy &amp; Services intervened in the matter and calculated the actual amount due.The municipality demanded the full historical debt and refused to enter into a consumer agreement with Jordaan to supply municipal services.Tshwane municipality found refuge in section 118 (3) of the Municipal Systems Act, which includes a security provision for historical debt to be incurred by the new owner.Fourie ruled that a property cannot be transferred unless the seller has a clearance certificate for the last two years of the debt. And holding the new owner liable for the debt that emanated before the two-year period is constitutionally invalid. Also, municipalities had no right to refuse municipal services if the historical debt was not paid.Having a sales agreementAlthough industry players don t expect owners who previously paid for old debt to seek relief in courts the consensus is that the judgement gives clarity on the powers of municipalities.As Oosthuizen &amp; Co Meyer de Waal Attorneys director Meyer de Waal puts it: the judgement is more positive for the buyer. If a municipality slaps you with municipal debt you can use this judgement to challenge the bill. Having a sales agreement in place before the transfer of a property appears to be the only way new owners can protect themselves.De Waal says the agreement must explicitly state that seller will undertake all debts. The agreement could be to the extent that the buyer will have a right to claim damages from the seller, should the purchaser at a later stage be faced with such a claim, he tells Moneyweb.Partner at Schindlers Attorneys Chantelle Gladwin supports De Waal s view adding that the sales agreement must be drafted by an attorney who understands how section 118 works. You want to specify that a seller will be responsible for paying all the historical debt and not just the amount required to get that transfer clearance certificate under for section 118 (1) because this amount is only billed in the two years prior to getting a clearance certificate. The full historic debt could remain even though a clearance certificate has been issued by only paying the two years of municipal debt, Gladwin tells Moneyweb.Part of the due diligence process should include looking at what kind of debt is attached to a property. This is important as the [Fourie] judgement did not overturn the legal principle of municipal debt attached to a property itself and not to the owner of a property. This still exists.
