JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand rallied nearly 2% on Monday as the emerging market selloff triggered by US President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s unexpected victory continued to fade.By 1540 GMT the rand had gained 1.66% to 14.2300 per dollar following a close at 14.4700 in New York on Friday.The rand, along with other emerging market currencies, rallied as the dollar stepped back from the previous week&#8217;s run to 14-year highs on bets that Trump would unleash a large fiscal stimulus package to revive the US economy.The rand was also boosted by higher commodity prices, especially the gold, which on Monday rebounded from 5-1/2 month lows as the spot price rose 0.5% to $1,214.4 an ounce.&#8220;It will be very interesting to see what happens in the next month or two. Usually a stronger dollar is not good for dollar-priced commodities; but if the US and China start buying more commodities for infrastructure, who knows,&#8221; the chief economist at Stanlib, Kevin Lings, said in a note.Trade volumes were low ahead of the South African Reserve Bank&#8217;s interest rate meeting on Thursday and the first of a clutch of credit rating decisions, by Moody&#8217;s, due after the market closes on Friday.South African stocks ended flat on Monday, with the benchmark Top-40 index edging 0.11% lower to 44,169.80 while the wider All-share index closed 0.06% lower at 50,592.52.Barloworld, the largest dealer of Caterpillar Inc mining trucks in southern Africa, was the biggest advancer on the day, adding 6.8% to R93.98 after posting slight rises in full-year profit and revenue.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 flat at 8.975%.
