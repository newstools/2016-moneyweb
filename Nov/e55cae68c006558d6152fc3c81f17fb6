JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa measures favourably in most indices bar economic growth, which the Treasury has forecast will be 0.5% this year, a Moody&#8217;s representative said on Tuesday.Moody&#8217;s rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade with a negative outlook and is due to publish its next review in December. Fellow ratings firms S&amp;P&#8217;s and Fitch have the country just a step above junk.The three agencies have warned that increased political infighting along with slowing growth could trigger downgrades.&#8220;South Africa is doing relatively well in a lot of the indices when you strip out growth &#8230; and when we look at a sovereign rating you&#8217;ve got to look through the cycle,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s country representative Sylvia Chahonyo told a business conference.At his budget speech last week Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan called for an end to &#8220;political noise&#8221; to help the economy recover and avoid downgrades.The state prosecutor on Monday dropped fraud charges against Gordhan, executing a U-turn in a case that has rattled financial markets and drawn accusations of political meddling.Investors have worried that Gordhan &#8211; who had brought some stability to South African markets since returning to the post during a currency crisis in December last year &#8211; would be removed from his job if he was prosecuted.Supporters of Gordhan and sympathetic financial analysts say all the charges could be a ploy by President Jacob Zuma and his allies to discredit a finance minister who stood in the way of their securing access to lucrative government contracts.The president has denied that he is in conflict with Gordhan.Deloitte&#8217;s managing director for Africa and Emerging Markets, Martyn Davies, told the conference that with Gordhan still at the helm, Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country would avoid downgrades by the &#8220;skin of our teeth&#8221;.
