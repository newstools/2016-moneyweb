CAPE TOWN &#8211; South African President Jacob Zuma survived a no-confidence vote on Thursday, after the anti-graft watchdog called in a report for a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government.The scandal highlighted in the report has rattled investors in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country and raised the risk the stagnating economy&#8217;s credit ratings will be downgraded.Zuma, 74, had the support of the African National Congress (ANC), which controls about two-thirds of the 400-member assembly. He has already survived a no-confidence motion and an impeachment vote this year, related to other scandals.&#8220;I think the no&#8217;s have it,&#8221; Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli ruled, after lawmakers of Zuma&#8217;s African National Congress (ANC), which controls almost two-thirds of the assembly, voted against the motion and burst into song in support of Zuma.The main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), which called the no-confidence motion against Zuma over what it described as his &#8220;reckless leadership&#8221;, asked for a re-count of the vote.Zuma, who was not in the assembly, won with 214 lawmakers voting against the motion, while 126 voted in favour and one abstained, a result that mirrored his victory in March.In his speech supporting the motion, the DA party leader Mmusi Maimane urged lawmakers to &#8220;stand up against state capture,&#8221; while Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said the motion was &#8220;ill-conceived and bound to fail.&#8221;The vote comes after the Public Protector, a constitutionally-mandated office, called for a judicial inquiry into allegations of corruption in Zuma&#8217;s government in a report titled &#8220;State of Capture&#8221; released last week.Zuma denies allegations that he granted undue influence to the Gupta family of business tycoons, who run a business empire from media to mining, or anyone else. The Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing.
