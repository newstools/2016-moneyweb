For a couple of years now, a rather prominent adult entertainment brand has been shopped around as a potential listing on the JSE.Unfortunately it has just never been able to grab the attention of the bourse or supporting advisors, who have always adopted a somewhat prudish approach to our capital markets. The announcement that Go Life International will be attempting a capital raise on the JSE should probably have been treated with similar circumspection.
