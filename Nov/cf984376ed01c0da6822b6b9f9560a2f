Redefine Properties grew its property assets by R8.9 billion to R72.7 billion for the 12 months to August 2016 in what has been a busy year for the real estate sector heavyweight.The growth in its assets is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of mid-cap property companies Emira Property Fund and Arrowhead Properties, cementing Redefine as one of the largest dealmakers in SA s more than R350 billion real estate sector.About R5.7 billion of the R8.9 billion growth recorded in its assets represents international acquisitions as Redefine recently made its foray into Poland.A big ticket investment that Redefine concluded was its acquisition of an initial 75% stake (later reduced to 49.9%) in Poland-focused Echo Polska Properties for 1 billion believed to be the single largest offshore property deal by a South African property company.Other acquisitions integrated into Redefine s property asset base are commercial properties from Leaf Capital Fund (a deal worth R4.1 billion) and Fountainhead Property Trust (a deal worth R14 billion) both concluded in the 2014 and 2015 respectively.Speaking at the annual results presentation on Thursday, CEO Andrew Konig says the company s international assets represent 22.6% of its total assets up from 14.8% in the previous year.More deals might be concluded in offshore markets, particularly in Poland. We are looking for opportunistic investments. We see more opportunities in that market that we can fund for ourselves, says Konig.Its other offshore interests include a 30% stake in UK and Germany focused- Redefine International; a 25.5% in Australian Stock Exchange Listed-Cromwell Property Group and a 27.5% stake in International Hotel Properties, the owner of hotel properties.Portfolio performanceRedefine s investors were rewarded with a 7.5% growth in dividend payouts to 86 cents per share. Management is forecasting that dividend growth will be between 7.5% to 8.5% in 2017.Meago Asset Managers director Jay Padayatchi says although the distribution outlook may be lower than the pre-annual results consensus, it s largely on the back of currency fluctuations and recent rand strength.Of course, property counters that derive earnings also in offshore markets are more sensitive to rand exchange movements.Stanlib s head of listed property funds Keillen Ndlovu supports Padayatchi s view, saying Redefine s dividend growth is in line with the asset manager s expectations. The outlook is reasonable, more so in a challenging and uncertain environment, says Ndlovu.Redefine, whose R51.7 billion direct property portfolio includes retail, office and industrial properties, saw vacancies decline from 5.4% to 4.9%, achieved rental growth of 5.1% and retained 92% of its tenants.Padayatchi tells Moneyweb: Operationally, many of the metrics were impressive in what is an increasingly difficult local property market: vacancy rates improving with most vacancies now lying in non-core assets, an improvement in the net property income and a high retention rate of 92% on expiring leases. It continues to extract value from its existing properties as it has undertaken on-going redevelopment projects valued at R1.1 billion and new development projects valued at R2.2 billion.Pending projects include the expansion of Gauteng s East Rand Mall and Centurion Mall to add more tenants; development of office property Rosebank Link; the sprucing up of South Coast Mall in KwaZulu-Natal and others.More opportunitiesKonig says Redefine is also on the prowl for deals in the student accommodation market and investments in the UK, despite market jitters about the region s possible exit from the European Union. On opportunities in the student accommodation market, Redefine already owns 51% in local student housing player Respublica which has identified Australia as its next growth vector.Redefine s property assets are expected to grow further if its pending acquisition of property developer Pivotal Property Fund is successful. The deal which is expected to be consummated in January 2017, will see Redefine take on Pivotal s property assets valued at R12.3 billion.Redefine s shares finished 1.83% lower on Thursday to R11.27.
