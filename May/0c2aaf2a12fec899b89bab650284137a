The Board of Investment Mauritius has announced plans to open a Johannesburg office later this year, in order to facilitate trade and investment with South Africa. The objective of opening up the office, together with the ministry of foreign affairs, is to create more visibility about Mauritius, about the investment opportunities that it provides and how best the Board of Investment can facilitate investment in Mauritius, said Nirmala Mahadeo-Jeetah from the Board of Investment Mauritius.Speaking on the sidelines of an investment roadshow in Johannesburg, Mahadeo-Jeetah said the local office would assist South Africans to identify investment opportunities in Mauritius, gain permits to set up businesses, advise on relocation and provide after-care services . It would also facilitate investment from Mauritius into South Africa.Mauritius counts South Africa as one of its main regional markets, with trade between the two countries topping MUR18 billion* last year. South Africa accounted for close to one fifth of foreign direct investment and over 100 000 tourist arrivals in Mauritius in 2015. It also issued 516 South Africans, mostly professionals and investors, with occupation and residence permits between January and April this year.
