Formal negotiations are now formally underway to combine the African retail business of Steinhoff with Shoprite. If successful, this will be the final step in Christo Wiese consolidating his retail assets on the continent in a single vehicle (with (primarily) UK assets held in Brait).The two-step transaction mechanism has been described in the joint detailed cautionary announcement. First, Steinhoff will receive shares in Shoprite in exchange for its retail businesses (effectively Pepkor, JD Group and Steinbuild). Then, it will issue shares in exchange for the PIC s and Titan s interests in Shoprite. While it says this may ultimately result in Steinhoff acquiring control of Retail Africa , it s almost certainly going to.In the announcement, the pro-forma combined revenue of these businesses is said to be approximately R200 billion in the year to end-June, with Ebitda of roughly R15 billion. Using data published by Steinhoff for the 12 months to June, revenue seems to be closer to R50 billion1 than the R70 billion needed to get to that magical R200 billion figure (Shoprite s turnover for the year was R130 billion). The Ebitda number, based on those Steinhoff figures, lines up almost exactly at R14.6 billion.But just how big would this combined business be?TurnoverStoresRetail AfricaR178.804bn7248Year to JuneShopriteR130.028bn2551Year to JuneSpar GroupR94.900bn2033Year to end SeptemberMassmartR88.125bn40552 weeks to JunePick n PayR74.940bn148052 weeks to AugustSteinhoff Retail AfricaR48.776bn4697Year to JuneWoolworthsR38.657bn69552 weeks to JuneEdconR26.620bn150252 weeks to JuneMr PriceR20.141bn1200**53 weeks to end SeptTFG***R18.273bn252652 weeks to SeptClicks Group****R16.640bn689Year to end AugDis-ChemR16.320bn10052 weeks to AugustTruworths***R12.889bn77052 weeks to June* Methodology: trailing 12 months of turnover to June/August/September used for all companies. ** Mr Price store data to end-March. *** Excludes UK acquisitions (Phase Eight for TFG and Office for Truworths)**** Retail sales only (excludes distribution business)Retail Africa will be roughly twice the size of its nearest competitors, led by the Spar Group in Southern Africa (including Spar, Tops and Build It) and Walmart s Massmart, on a pure turnover basis! The turnover figure for Spar is for the actual sales through the tills (as disclosed), far higher than the revenue figure published for Southern Africa by the listed group (which is essentially a wholesaler to its guild members). It will be more than twice the size of Pick n Pay.On a number of stores basis, Retail Africa will be more than three times bigger than Spar, almost five times the size of Pick n Pay (including the Boxer, Liquor and Clothing units) and an astonishing 18 times bigger than big-box retailer Massmart.The combined group would see more than half its revenue originate from food retail (the supermarket business) as only 10% (R13 billion) of Shoprite s total turnover is from its furniture business and other operating segments . This means R116 billion of the somewhere between R180 billion and R200 billion (depending on how you arrive at the combined revenue for the group) would be from food.General merchandise (primarily clothing) will be the next largest segment. Pepkor Africa s revenue for the 12 months was somewhere around R36 billion.The furniture segment (what s left of JD Group plus House and Home, OK Furniture and OK Express) would have revenue of approximately R11 billion to R12 billion. DIY/building supplies arguably doesn t fit into the (potentially) combined business, given how tiny it is by comparison. While not disclosed, revenue could hardly be more than R5 billion. From a number of stores perspective, it would be only 2% of the enlarged group.Trading margins would look something like:Source: Author&#8217;s research, estimatesAdjusted, normalised figures (i.e. excluding furniture in the supermarket business) might look more like 5%, 13% and 7%.Retail Africa*StoresArea ( 000 m2)Clothing (general merchandise)36981501Pep1990735Ackermans577388Dunns, John Craig, Shoe City, Refinery514131Tekkie Town325130Pep Africa (ex SADC), Powersales292117&nbsp;Supermarkets (/food/liquor)205437023Shoprite57719474Checkers2026636Checkers Hyper372831Usave3552396OK Franchise3594847Hungry Lion187295Liquorshop337546&nbsp;Furniture (Household Goods)13593894House and Home531026OK Furniture3872264OK Express57141JD Group862463&nbsp;DIY and Building Suppliers137360Steinbuild137360&nbsp;TOTAL724842778* Data to June 30 2016. Area data for Shoprite Holdings group brands are not disclosed and these are estimates based on store format data published by its property division. Retail Africa would operate in 15 countries, including South Africa. However, operations would largely be concentrated in Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique and Zambia).The next biggest markets would be Nigeria and Angola. Shoprite operates roughly 20 stores (18 as at June 30 2016) in Nigeria and a similar number in Angola. Pep has a similar number in the former and double the amount in the latter.While the data in this analysis is for the entire group (i.e. across Africa), the situation in South Africa might be cause for concern at competition authorities. Steinhoff publishes its market shares in countries in which it operates and the SA data (as at September 30 2016) looks like this:A combined Shoprite and Steinhoff s African retail business in this market (excluding the Unitrans automotive unit) would push its market share to well over 30% (not quite 35%, given the required Unitrans adjustment). This would be completely unprecedented. There might be a wrinkle in Wiese s plan, after all 1 The calculation is simple: Steinhoff International reported revenue of 4.236 billion from Africa. Subtract the 1.210 billion from its automotive unit (disclosed separately) and you get to 3.026 billion. The average rand/euro exchange rate for the period is disclosed as 16.1191. This translates to R48.776 billion. Recently acquired Tekkie Town provides a further R1.3 billion in revenue, on a pro-forma basis.* Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
