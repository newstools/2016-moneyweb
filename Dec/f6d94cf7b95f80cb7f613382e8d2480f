LONDON &#8211; Emerging market equities hit five-day highs on Tuesday, with the Moscow bourse at fresh peaks as investors shrugged off the results of Italy&#8217;s referendum, while a weaker dollar helped currencies such as the rand and the lira make gains.Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign after the weekend&#8217;s referendum, which saw voters reject his plans for constitutional reform, initially stoking fears about political stability and Italy&#8217;s banking system.But financial markets recovered on Tuesday with the benchmark emerging equities index up 0.8% and set for its best performance in a week, helped by strong gains from emerging Europe to Asia.&#8220;The Italy concern was maybe too much priced in, so we saw a reversal,&#8221; said Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank. &#8220;The fear that we may have seen a meltdown in Italy, which could hit global risk sentiment, is waning with the expectation that we will get a new government of some sort.&#8221;He added that markets were also eyeing Thursday&#8217;s European Central Bank meeting, to see if it will extend its bond-buying programme by six months. &#8220;That would be positive for emerging market currencies,&#8221; he said.Moscow shares outperformed, up 0.9% at record highs. Russian central bank first deputy governor Ksenia Yudayeva said Russia&#8217;s economy was recovering and would return to growth in the first quarter of 2017. Polish stocks rose 1.1%, extending Monday&#8217;s 3.5% gains to a three-month high after Poland dodged a credit downgrade to junk status from S&amp;P Global on Friday. Turkish stocks rallied 1.4% and Prague shares rose 0.9%.Earlier in Asia, South Korean stocks closed up 1.35% at two-week highs. Scandal-hit President Park Geun-hye said she would accept the result of an impeachment vote this week.Taiwan stocks rose almost 1% and Hong Kong shares climbed 0.75% on the second day of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stocks link.But Chinese mainland stocks fell further in the wake of scathing comments by a securities regulator about &#8220;barbaric&#8221; takeovers.With the dollar holding near a three-week low against a basket of currencies, some emerging market currencies made some headway.The South African rand firmed 0.7% although third-quarter economic growth was below forecast at 0.2%.&#8220;Today&#8217;s data highlights that the South African economy remains extremely weak,&#8221; John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics, said in a note, suggesting interest rates will be left unchanged rather than hiked.Christensen said the rand could still be benefiting from the fact that ratings agency S&amp;P Global held off downgrading South Africa&#8217;s sovereign debt to junk on Friday. &#8220;Half the market thought they would lose its investment grade rating, so that is giving the currency some tailwind. But that&#8217;s not to say they are off the hook.&#8221;The Turkish lira also strengthened 0.3% from recent record lows, although the central bank warned that currency weakness could drive up prices and push the bank off its targets in the first quarter of next year.China&#8217;s yuan hit a near three-week high as the central bank set its daily guidance rate firmer than some investors had expected.The Polish zloty and Hungarian forint weakened a touch against the euro. Hungary&#8217;s economic growth slowed to an annual 2.2% in the third quarter, but this was better than a 2% first estimate.
