JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s headline consumer inflation accelerated to 6.6 percent year-on-year as expected in November from 6.4 percent in October, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.On a month-on-month basis, inflation slowed to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent previously.Core inflation, which excludes the prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, petrol and energy, was unchanged at 5.7 percent year-on-year in November but edged lower to 0.1 percent on a month-on-month basis from 0.2 percent.&nbsp;PERCENTAGE CHANGEY/YY/YM/MM/MNovOctNovOctFood, *NAB11.611.70.50.9Alcoholic bev, tobacco55.200.2Clothing, footwear5.35.40.30.4Housing, utilities5.45.400Household contents3.84.1-0.40.3Health5.55.10.20.7Transport6.44.31.51.1Communication-0.2-0.1-0.10Recreation and culture66.7-0.20.5Education4.64.600Restaurants, hotels6.46.90.60.8Miscellaneous goods7.57.5-0.10.4All items6.66.40.30.5*non-alcoholic beverages&nbsp;&nbsp;PERCENTAGE CHANGEY/YY/YM/MM/MNovOctNovOctVery low expend8.18.20.20.4Low expend7.87.90.20.5Middle expend7.27.30.20.5Higher expend6.66.40.30.6Very high expend6.46.20.30.5CommentIn a note on Wednesday, Nedbank&#8217;s Group Economic Unit said inflation&#8217;s expected to remain above 6% in the very short term, &#8220;but to dip back within the South African Reserve Bank s (Sarb&#8217;s) target range as food prices come under some control as the drought dissipates.&#8221;&#8220;According to Agbiz, the latest developments out from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology suggest that South Africa might have a normal rainfall season next year and not the above normal rainfall predicted earlier. Despite this, the local market is still optimistic about the 2017/18 summer crop which should bring some food price relief and so lower consumer inflation.&#8220;The main concern for the Sarb is still the rand and its effect on inflation. A major rand event would have been a downgrade of the country s credit rating to subinvestment grade by one or more of the credit rating agencies, but this has been avoided for 2016.&#8220;The next potentially rand-moving event is today s interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve. If the Fed does hike rates this afternoon, the rand may weaken and this could keep the possibility of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the Sarb alive in the early part of next year. However, the next major move in rates is likely to be down, probably starting in the second half of 2017.&#8221;In an insight note on Wednesday Wandile Sihlobo, head of economic and agribusiness intelligence at the Agricultural Business Chamber, said the overall decline in food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation was driven by milk, eggs, and cheese; oils and fats; vegetables and other foods which eased at 10.2% y/y, 12.0% y/y, 12.2% y/y and 12.3% y/y, respectively.&#8220;The decrease in milk, eggs, and cheese inflation coincide with seasonal milk price trend which normally decelerates during mid-summer season owing to an increase domestic milk supplies on the back of improving grazing fields. Moreover, oils and fats inflation mirror the domestic sunflower seed prices which have maintained a declining trend due to relatively large domestic supplies. The fall in vegetable inflation coincides with increasing domestic supplies on the back of ongoing harvest for a number of vegetable crops.&#8220;Meanwhile, bread and cereals, meat, fish, fruit and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerated to 17.0% y/y, 6.0% y/y, 10.6% y/y, 25.0% y/y and 9.6% y/y, respectively. To some extent, the increase in these food products inflation still mirror the effects of the 2015/16 drought.&#8220;Looking ahead, we maintain our view that overall food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation could remain elevated this year. However, we foresee a slowing trend for most food products inflation in 2017, with the exception of meat which is likely to maintain the upward trend over the coming months due to expected decline in slaughtering rate,&#8221; said Sihlobo.
