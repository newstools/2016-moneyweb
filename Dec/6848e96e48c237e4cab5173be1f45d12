JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand traded a tad weaker against the dollar on Wednesday in a market braced for a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike.* At 0647 GMT, rand at 13.6550 to the greenback, down 0.37 percent from its New York close at 13.6050 on Tuesday.* Consumer inflation data at 0800 GMT expected to have little impact, but will keep door open for South African Reserve Bank to hike domestic rates in January if it pulls further above 3-6 percent target band.* Rand still on track to end the year up more than 13 percent versus the dollar, which would be its first annual gain since 2010, helped mainly by investors&#8217; search for yield in emerging markets.* Stock futures index edges up 0.28 percent, pointing to a slightly firmer start for Johannesburg bourse.* Government bonds retreat in early trade, pushing yield for 10-year debt up 4 basis points to 8.94 percent.
