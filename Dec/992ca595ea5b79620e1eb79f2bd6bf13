JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s manufacturing and mining output fell in October from a year ago, data showed on Thursday, pointing to weak economic growth in the fourth quarter after the economy barely grew in the third quarter.Statistics South Africa said manufacturing output contracted by 2.7% year-on-year in October after expanding by 0.2% in September, and lagging market expectations of a 0.65% increase.On a month-on-month basis, factory production fell 1.9% and edged down 1.8% in the three months to October compared with the previous three months, it said.Separately, mining output fell 2.9% year-on-year in October after expanding by 4.7% the previous month.The rand fell more than 1% to dollar to a session low of 13.6400 after the mining data was released, and extended its losses when the manufacturing data was announced.Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note that both the manufacturing and mining data suggest the economy may have performed even worse in the fourth quarter than it did in the third.&#8220;This supports our view that economic momentum will be very weak going into 2017 and that the South African Reserve Bank will probably keep its key policy rate on hold,&#8221; he said.&#8220;October&#8217;s mining and manufacturing data were both worse than even the most pessimistic analysts had expected.Gross domestic product expanded by only 0.2% in the period between July to September as the manufacturing sector contracted sharply. The GDP data renewed fears that the reprieve from credit ratings downgrades will only be temporary.Ratings agencies S&amp;P, Fitch and Moody&#8217;s have cited weak growth as a risk to South Africa&#8217;s investment-grade status.
