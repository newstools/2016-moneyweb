The application by the former deputy registrar of pension funds at the Financial Services Board (FSB), Rosemary Hunter, that the court should supervise an investigation into the cancellation of thousands of dormant pension funds by the FSB has been dismissed in the Pretoria High Court.Hunter has for years been fighting to have the cancellations project more thoroughly scrutinised, as she believes that the process was flawed. However, it appears that her involvement may have now reached its end.Judge Hendrik Jacobs found that Hunter had failed to set out with the required measure of particularity, facts and conclusions of law to support her application. She did not convince the court that it had the jurisdiction to order the FSB and the Minister to perform a certain act in a certain manner and then to supervise compliance with the order .Judge Jacobs ordered the FSB to pay Hunter&#8217;s costs up to 1 August 2016, but ordered that Hunter should pay the costs of all the respondents from that date. The five respondents in the case were the FSB itself, its chairman Abel Sithole, chief registrar Dube Tshidi, deputy registrar Jurgen Boyd and the Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan.The court found that the application is not one of genuine constitutional import and therefore that the &#8216;Biowatch principle&#8217; should not apply. This refers to a decision by the Constitutional Court that an individual who is seeking to assert their constitutional rights against a public entity should be indemnified against paying costs.Hunter noted that she was deeply disappointed by the judgement and would be considering applying for leave to appeal.Disputes of fact The court however made no finding on whether or not Hunter was correct in her assessment that the cancellations project was either unlawful or mismanaged. Judge Jacobs noted that the papers filed by the various parties show several genuine disputes of fact and that it is not within my remit to consider or adjudicate upon the merits or demerits of the cancellation project .In other words, the questions raised by Hunter with regards to the project itself still need to be answered. The court however noted that an investigation into whether or not anyone suffered genuine financial prejudice when funds were de-registered is still underway.That investigation is being conducted by pension fund lawyer Jonathan Mort, and the court was presented with his second inspection report in the course of the proceedings. That report shows that while Mort has found nothing untoward in most of the cases he has looked at, he has identified one fund that should not have been cancelled as it still has assets and two more funds of significant concern .The potential scale of the financial prejudice suffered by members in those two funds is over R40 million. It is therefore beyond dispute that there were problems, but the extent still needs to be determined.A potential issue here is that Mort noted that the biggest risk in respect of the de-registration process was around unclaimed benefits . This was because members who are aware that they are owed money by a fund would inevitably raise a concern if they couldn&#8217;t locate it. However, where members don&#8217;t know that they are owed something, this may go undetected.War of wordsJudge Jacobs also expressed his displeasure for the way in which all parties had conducted themselves over the course of what he referred to as an acrimonious dispute . He noted how the differences in opinion about the cancellations project between Hunter on the one hand and Boyd and Tshidi on the other gave rise to a war of words that waged in the offices of the FSB for years and throughout these proceedings .He suggested that it should not have been necessary to involve the courts and that it should have been possible to resolve the matter far more amicably: In my view, all of the parties to the litigation (except the minister) are to blame for the state of affairs, he argued. Reasonable litigants would have terminated the litigation. FSB
