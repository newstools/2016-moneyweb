South Africa&#8217;s main opposition party said on Monday it had asked the Constitutional Court to compel President Jacob Zuma to establish a judicial inquiry into alleged influence-peddling in his government.The Democratic Alliance&#8217;s (DA) application came days after Zuma asked the High Court to set aside a report by the former Public Protector which called for an investigation into whether he and some cabinet members and state companies had acted improperly.&#8220;The DA has filed papers in the Constitutional Court to seek a declaratory order that President Jacob Zuma has violated his constitutional obligations in not giving effect to the remedial action set out in Public Protector&#8217;s State Capture report by establishing a Commission of Inquiry by 2 December 2016,&#8221; the party said in a statement.&#8220;Our application seeks the Constitutional Court to compel President Zuma to give effect to this remedial action and appoint the commission within ten days of the order of the court.&#8221;Zuma has described the report, drawn up by the then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, as &#8220;unfair&#8221; in parliament. He wants the court to send the report back to the anti-graft unit, now headed by Busisiwe Mkhwebane, for further investigation and says Madonsela had no right to call for a judicial inquiry.The watchdog&#8217;s report, released on Nov. 2, focused on allegations that businessmen Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations.The report &#8211; which Zuma had sought to block through the courts before it was made public &#8211; called for a judicial inquiry be set up by the president and for a judge to be appointed by the chief justice within 30 days of its release.Zuma, 74, has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption since taking office in 2009.
