Global and domestic factors, including perceptions of weakening governance and uncertainty about policy direction, are likely to weigh on South Africa&#8217;s economic growth next year, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.Investors are worried about whether the government can implement policies to boost flagging growth amid a probe into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for his role in setting up a unit at the tax department that police say illegally spied on politicians. Gordhan has denied any wrongdoing.In October, state prosecutors dropped fraud charges against Gordhan, in a case that had rocked financial markets and drawn accusations of political meddling.For his part, President Jacob Zuma has been accused of involvement in several corruption scandals. The anti-graft watchdog this month asked for a judge to investigate alleged influence-peddling by a wealthy family with close ties to Zuma, who denies any wrongdoing.&#8220;Despite the strength of South Africa&#8217;s institutions, perceptions of weakening governance and of rising uncertainty regarding the direction of policies have been associated with low investment and consumer confidence,&#8221; the IMF said on Tuesday after a visit from members of its staff.The global lender cut its 2016 growth forecast for Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy to 0.1% from 0.6% earlier this year, and a senior fund official separately said corruption was hampering the reforms needed to boost growth.The Treasury has cut its own economic growth forecast for this year to 0.5% from 0.9%.&#8220;Should the slowdown be prolonged, the state of the public finances would face greater risks from declining investor confidence,&#8221; the IMF said.However, it added that improved electricity supply would help the economy, and noted that wage agreements had been reached with only limited strike action.
