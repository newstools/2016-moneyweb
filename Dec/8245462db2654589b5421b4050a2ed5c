The highly regarded hedge fund manager with offices in Johannesburg and London has had a tough year, with returns for its flagship Global Emerging Markets Fund (managed in London) deep in the red for the eleven months ending November. But the firm cannot be accused of deluding itself: 2016 has been a truly humbling year and we feel sickened by our losses after years of consistent performance, read the letter sent to investors on Tuesday. The 27-page document provides a detailed explanation of the reasons for the underperformance and describes the action the firm has taken to mitigate similar types of events impacting performance again. From an institutional perspective, we are satisfied with the systems and processes we have in place to manage money. But this year has shown that we may be entering a new normal for markets, where traditional correlations and relationships are breaking down. To address this, we have been building new, bespoke systems to help our investment managers navigate the choppy waters ahead and allow the great stocks they have discovered to achieve their potential,&#8221; the firm said in response to questions from Moneyweb. The graph below reveals the annual performance of the fund by calendar year, from its inception in 2008 until the end of November this year, and it demonstrates just how tough 2016 has been. While the fund has incurred losses of 26.4% year-to-date, its longer-term record remains intact with a total return of 97% since the fund s inception (translating to 8% a year). By comparison, the MSCI Emerging Markets Total Return Index was down 10% over the same period. The performance of the GEMS fund has not affected the returns of the locally run Capricorn Stable Fund which has continued its impressive run.

The scale of the moves against us on the commodity shorts were also exceptional, with structurally challenged names rallying hundreds of percent in a matter of months. As an example of the yo-yo action seen in the price of commodity shares, examine the graph below, where the share prices of Anglo American (blue), BHP Billiton (green), and Glencore (purple) are represented for the last two years. Prices collapsed towards the end of 2015 before rapidly reversing course this year. Capricorn had anticipated certain resource companies, and in particular those of gold, would remain under pressure into 2016. The resource rally turned out to be indicative of a broader shift that was taking place from growth to value stocks that began at the start of the year.Source: IRESSThe fallout from Brexit meant that many of the core holdings in the fund s South African book experienced diminished earnings from investments in British companies, due to the devaluation of the British Pound. The election of Donald Trump was also a key moment for the positioning of the fund. The firm anticipated &#8211; as many did &#8211; that a Clinton victory would solidify the status quo in terms of US economic policy, and this certainty would continue to support US markets. The lack of tangible policy proposals from Trump seemed to indicate the market would not like the uncertainty associated with his administration, should he win. This summation appeared to be correct initially, before US markets began rallying to the idea of a Trump administration lowering corporate taxes, deregulating the economy, and investing heavily in infrastructure. The S&amp;P 500 has since reached new all-time highs. In contrast, Emerging Market indices have reflected the increase in uncertainty and fear of trade wars, pulling back sharply and indiscriminately, wrote Capricorn. The portfolio has now been positioned for a pull-back in what Capricorn describes as over-extended markets. The firm has made two new appointments in Johannesburg (with one more expected in London imminently) to help exploit the opportunities it currently sees.
