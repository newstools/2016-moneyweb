JOHANNESBURG National Treasury has softened its stance on the inclusion of products that charge performance fees in default retirement portfolios.In its revised draft default regulations for retirement funds published on Friday, it did not as in the initial draft prohibit products that charge performance fees from inclusion in default investment portfolios.Default options are automatic choices made on behalf of retirement fund members who do not exercise their choices in a given situation. By law, retirement funds are not currently required to offer default options. Where they exist, some of the current defaults could be favouring the interests of service providers and work against the interest of members. International research shows that replacing bad defaults with good defaults can significantly improve outcomes, since the members customers are defaulted into certain decisions, choices, or strategies, and then tend to remain in those options, Treasury said.While the revised proposals are open for public comment until the end of February next year, it is unclear when the default regulations will ultimately take effect. The expectation is that it may only be after 2017. The first draft was released in July last year.National Treasury has been quite critical of performance fee structures in the past and has excluded products that charge performance fees from inclusion in tax-free savings accounts due to the uncertain and sometimes costly nature of these products and because fees can fluctuate quite a lot.But although it seems to have made an about-turn around performance fees in its default retirement regulations, it has reserved the right to review its decision, suggesting that it remains sceptical. Investments that have a performance fee element will also be allowed subject to, in the interim, compliance with an industry standard that should simplify methodology and disclosure, and funds motivating their use to the FSB as part of their compliance with the default regulations and Regulation 28. The standard could ultimately be supplemented or replaced by an FSB regulatory standard. The appropriateness of performance fees will be monitored during both the industry and FSB sanctioned standard, to enable review of the policy decision if necessary, it said.Arno Loots, head of umbrella fund solutions at Liberty Corporate, says performance fees are embedded in asset classes like private equity.Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act allows pension funds to allocate up to 10% of their assets to private equity.Loots says Treasury has realised the role these alternative assets play in increasing returns at lower or more acceptable risk levels and that it can be beneficial for retirement fund members.But the fact that these products will be allowed in the interim suggests that Treasury will continue its scrutiny of performance fee structures, he says.Other revisionsIn addition, Treasury s second draft does not prohibit the inclusion of products that have elements of a guarantee or smoothing.A previous requirement that boards should consider member characteristics and needs has been removed from the revised draft.Treasury clarified that a former requirement that boards should consider passive management was not meant to suggest that boards should only adopt passive investment strategies as a default.The first draft recommended that the retirement pot should follow the member by default in addition to in-fund default preservation. This has been revised and a member s retirement pot can only be consolidated with his or her consent.According to the initial default pot follows member proposal, if an employee resigned from employer A to join employer B, fund administrator A was obligated to ensure the money was transferred to administrator B. Additionally, administrator B had to go look for the money . This created a significant administrative burden, Loots explains.Under the revised regulations, the money will stay with administrator A until the employee explicitly requests a transfer.The default annuity proposal has also been amended to make the purchase of an annuity a soft default by having the member opt in instead of opting out .Loots says the industry agrees with the principle of defaults, but in terms of the initial draft proposal, the practical application of the defaults wasn t optimal. I think the second draft made quite a few improvements on the practical aspects of it. He expects that a large number of non-advised retirement fund members will benefit from defaults.The move to a more principle-based approach will avoid restrictive regulation and is welcomed, he says.
