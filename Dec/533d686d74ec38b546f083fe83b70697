JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Business confidence in South Africa rose to its highest in four months in November, helped by improvements in new vehicle sales and manufacturing output, a survey showed on Wednesday.The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry&#8217;s (SACCI) monthly business confidence index (BCI) rose to 93.9 in November, its highest reading since August, from 93.0 in October.&#8220;Positive monthly contributions to the BCI mainly came from real value of building plans passed, new vehicle sales (seasonally adjusted) and manufacturing output,&#8221; SACCI said.&#8220;Notwithstanding the volatility in the business climate, the present turnaround in the BCI could gather more momentum.&#8221;
