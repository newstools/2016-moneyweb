We will probably be moving to about 7 trillion naira in the 2017 budget,&#8221; Osinbajo said during visits to manufacturers on Thursday.He said Nigeria&#8217;s economy of around 90 trillion naira ($285.3 billion) needed more spending to make an impact.

Its revenues from oil have plunged along as the price of crude fell and militants attacked its crude-producing heartland, the Niger Delta, cutting its output.Ratings agency Moody&#8217;s forecast the Nigerian economy would expand 2.5 percent next year if it could produce 2.2 million barrels of oil per day &#8211; the level at which the government made its 2016 budget calculations.On Wednesday, Budget Minister Udoma Udo Udoma said the cabinet had approved next year&#8217;s budget without providing details.
