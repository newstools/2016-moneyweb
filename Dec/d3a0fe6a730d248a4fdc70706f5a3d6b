On Wednesday, the application by the former deputy registrar of pension funds at the Financial Services Board (FSB), Rosemary Hunter, that the court should supervise an investigation into the cancellation of thousands of dormant pension funds by the FSB was dismissed in the Pretoria High Court.For years, Hunter has been fighting to have the cancellations project thoroughly scrutinised, as she believes that the process was flawed.On Thursday she released the following statement:&nbsp;Yesterday the FSB issued a media statement in which it said that it felt vindicated by the dismissal of my application by acting Judge Hendrik Jacobs in the North Gauteng High Court.It should feel nothing of the sort.The FSB also said that it had always acted in good faith in its approach .The FSB has, however, failed to acknowledge in its media statement that- The FSB s endeavours to get rid of the applicant at all cost, first by way of a golden hand shake and later by way of a failed disciplinary process, fueled the applicant s efforts to pursue what she perceives as a quest for justice from which the general public would benefit. She retaliated with a process of suspicion mongering against Mr Tshidi. The FSB chose to deny the applicant, who was in law an employee of it charged with performing a statutory duty access to the O Regan report and the KPMG report which were both produced as a direct consequence of the applicant s concern [about the legality of the pension fund s cancellations project and the manner in which had been conducted]. That conduct of the FSB gave rise to the litigation or at least part of it. I am deeply disappointed by the judgment and orders was handed down yesterday particularly as, in my respectful opinion, the judgment has not properly addressed the substantive issues raised in my application.I am consulting my legal team about bringing an application for leave to appeal and/or other steps which may be taken by me and/or other people to address Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this litigation, the National Treasury, Parliament, NGOs and members of the public must hold the Financial Services Board to account for the manner in which the cancellations project and the subsequent cover-up campaign were conducted and registrar s duty to identify and ensure that any prejudice that anyone has suffered as a result is remedied.If we claim to uphold the Constitution and to subscribe to the values underpinning it, we cannot turn our backs on the most vulnerable in our society, both in South Africa and in the sub-Saharan region from which many workers in South Africa have been drawn, even if we do not know their names or what it might have meant, and still mean, to them to be deprived of retirement savings that they, or those on whom they depended for support earned through their labour.
