Tesla Motors Inc. said it&#8217;s voluntarily recalling about 7,000 adapters for electric-vehicle charging after two reports of overheating that resulted in melted plastic on the adapters. The rarely used accessory item is sold through the company&#8217;s online store. Two customers reported overheating in November, according to an e-mail the company is sending Tuesday to customers. No damage besides the melted plastic was reported, and Tesla said it notified US regulators of its voluntary recall today.The equipment affected is the NEMA 14-30 adapters, which are sometimes used to charge Tesla vehicles via clothes-drier appliance outlets in US homes. No international customers are affected.Replacements will be shipped beginning in the next few weeks, and customers should avoid using them in the meantime. The company will also be replacing the NEMA 10-30 and 6-50 adapters, which have a similar design, and those replacements will take about three months, according to the company. 2016 Bloomberg
