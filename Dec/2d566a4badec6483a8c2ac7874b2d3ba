Wall Street climbed on Tuesday as telecom stalwarts AT&amp;T and Verizon gained and bank shares added to their torrid post-election rally, helping the Dow set another record closing high.The S&amp;P financial sector rose nearly 1%, lifted by a 2.2% gain for Wells Fargo.

The company said its new streaming television service DirectTV Now has so far exceeded expectations.Verizon shares climbed 1.2%.
