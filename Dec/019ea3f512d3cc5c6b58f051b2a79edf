At the age of 25, a young Zulu man in a business environment dominated by white, older males, grew a division of Metro Cash &amp; Carry from a R16 million entity to a R463 million burgeoning success.That young man is Vusi Thembekwayo. Today he is 31 and still utterly convinced that his success came about through not seeing the business from his own perspective, but from a number of different viewpoints.This is why, in his consulting firm, he talks to his own clients about the four laws of leadership &#8211; the first being that the role of a business leader is to find the truth, not a version of the truth and most certainly not their own version of the truth.In this (2 50 ) quick insight, extracted from a full-length interview, Thembekwayo reveals this particular aspect of his story and discusses the personal business principles which were so instrumental in his success.Watch the full video here.In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people. The interview draws on the person s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.Other business leaders share their stories here.
