South Africa&#8217;s economy barely grew in the third quarter of the year as the manufacturing sector contracted sharply, renewing fears that the reprieve from ratings downgrades will only be temporary.Gross domestic product expanded by only 0.2% in the period between July to September compared with a revised 3.5% in the second quarter, Statistics South Africa said on Tuesday.At market prices:Q3&#8217;16Q2&#8217;16GDP q/q*0.23.5GDP y/y**0.70.6* Seasonally adjusted and annualised pct changes ** UnadjustedThe figure was just shy of the 0.5% growth anticipated by economist polled by Reuters.The rand firmed in response to the release of the data, touching a session high of 13.6400 per dollar from 13.7300/dollar before its release.On year-on-year basis the economy grew at 0.7% from 0.6% previously.&nbsp;Q/Q seasonally adjusted, annualised change by sector&nbsp;Q3&#8217;16Q2&#8217;16Agriculture-0.3-0.8Mining and quarrying5.116.1Manufacturing-3.28.1Electricity, gas &amp; water-2.9-1.8Construction0.3-0.2Wholesale, retail-2.11.4Transport, comms0.32.9Finance, real estate1.22.9General govt. service1.81Personal services0.60.8The meagre growth in the quarter was led by a 3.2% decline in the manufacturing sector, followed by a 2.8% decline in the electricity sector and a 2.1% contraction in trade and accommodation.&#8220;The decline in manufacturing is very concerning,&#8221; chief economist at Nedbank Nicky Weimar said.Manufacturing now accounts for only 13% of the economy, down from around 25% two decades ago.&#8220;The ratings agencies anticipated this weakness but the point is if we don&#8217;t get faster growth it will be much harder to improve our fiscal metrics and improve (reduce) unemployment.&#8221;Last Friday S&amp;P Global Ratings kept South Africa&#8217;s sovereign debt score unchanged on the lowest investment level with a negative outlook, but cut the country&#8217;s local debt rating to match the sovereign.The agency cited weak growth, increasing state debt as well political uncertainty as reasons for the continued negative outlook.CommentsIn a note released on Tuesday, Nedbank&#8217;s Group Economic Unit said it expects the economy to &#8220;fare only slightly better&#8221; in the fourth quarter, with a GDP growth rate of 0.4% in 2016 as a whole.&#8220;The outlook for 2017 remains uncertain, with more positive contributions expected from agriculture, mining and manufacturing. However, consumer spending will remain constrained, but confidence should improve as inflation eases and interest rates begin to fall in the second half of next year. Expectations of stronger growth should also encourage some recovery in fixed investment off a very low base. In contrast, further restraint is expected from government given the need to restore fiscal discipline. On balance, the economy is likely to grow by just over 1% in 2017.The bank&#8217;s unit says the latest GDP figures confirm that the economy is still weak but, although modestly, it managed to grow. Also encouraging is the fact that the country escaped being downgraded. &#8220;Although these developments have reduced the chances of further monetary tightening in early 2017, the MPC is likely to remain cautious given the downside risks posed to the rand by a volatile domestic political landscape and changing global dynamics. Consequently, the probability of another 25 basis point hike in interest rates early next year cannot be completely ruled out. By the second half of 2017 interest rates should begin easing as inflation begins to fall,&#8221; states the Nedbank unit.In the soundclip below Michael Manamela, the chief director for national accounts at Statistics South Africa, comments on the GDP results:&nbsp;
