South Africa&#8217;s rand weakened on Wednesday as traders treaded cautiously ahead of major data releases late this week, with Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s the last of three main rating agencies to decide on the country&#8217;s debt.Stocks booked their fourth straight monthly drop as investors fled risky assets in the wake of resurgent dollar and signs of economic strength in the United States.At 23:45, the rand had slipped 1.29% to 14.0701 per dollar following an overnight close of 13.8825, bringing the month&#8217;s losses to more than four%.The rand and other emerging currencies fell after a jobs report from the United States showed a surprise increase in employment, further solidifying bets the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month.The rand began the week on the front foot after Fitch and Moody&#8217;s affirmed South Africa&#8217;s investment grade status over the weekend, but has since retreated due to a dollar surge and worries that S&amp;P&#8217;s may buck the trend and cut the rating to junk.&#8220;The market is a bit cautious with a lot of data out on Friday,&#8221; said market analyst at IG Group Shaun Murison.&#8220;With S&amp;P&#8217;s it will be close, but it looks like we&#8217;ve done enough to keep our heads above board.&#8221;The blue-chip JSE Top-40 index little changed at 43,691, bringing losses for November to nearly 1%. The broader All-share index edged up 0.1% at 50,209.Petrochemical giant Sasol topped the gainers list on the benchmark index, jumping 4.8% to R379.35, tracking a surge in the price of crude oil.Sasol makes fuel from coal and gas but sells at same price as companies that import and refine crude, which climbed more than 7% as the world&#8217;s largest producers agreed to curb output for the fist time since 2008.On the downside, Steinhoff was under pressure, falling 4.3% to R65.44 as the stock started trading without the rights to its next dividend payout.About 242 million shares changed hands, below last year&#8217;s daily average of 296 million shares.Bonds were mostly flat with the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 1 basis point to 9.04%.
