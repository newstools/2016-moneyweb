JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The rand retreated from a two-week peak in thin trade on Friday, taking its direction largely from global moves after South African financial markets closed early on the last trading day for 2016.Stocks ended on a weak note, with the Top-40 index down 0.17% at 43,901.99 points, while the broader All-share index dipped 0.06% to 50,653.54.The rand swung from a high of 13.5500/dollar, its strongest since Dec. 13, to Friday&#8217;s trough of 13.8100, before clawing back to 13.7309 by 00:27 on Saturday morning. This was down 0.93% from Thursday&#8217;s New York close at 13.6050.The currency is still on track to end the year up about 13% versus the dollar, its first annual gain since 2010.The recovery comes after the rand tumbled last December when President Jacob Zuma changed finance ministers twice in less than a week, damaging investor confidence.Gains this year have however been capped by investors&#8217; lingering worries that internal strife within the governing ANC party could distract the Treasury from efforts to boost flagging economic growth, seen at 0.5 percent at most in 2016.&#8220;South Africa &#8230; will see an overarching political narrative as the ANC moves to its elective conference in December and shocks within government can occur. All this should keep growth weak,&#8221; Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto said in a note.On the bourse on Friday, shares in gold mining firms rose as the bullion price firmed, with Anglogold Ashanti the biggest gainer among the blue-chips, advancing 3.4 percent to 152.58 rand.But life insurer Sanlam declined 2.3 percent to 62.90 rand, weighing on the bourse.The Top-40 ended 4.1 percent lower for the year, but the All-share index was up 0.8 percent since the first trading day of 2016.Trading was muted on Friday, with 89 million shares changing hands, according to preliminary bourse data, compared to last year&#8217;s daily average of 296 million.Government bonds closed unchanged, with the yield for 2026 benchmark instrument flat at 8.925 percent.
