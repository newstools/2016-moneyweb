Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Oil jumpsA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for January delivery was trading 5% higher at $54.07 at 4:41am ET. The surge comes after non-Opec countries including Russia pledged to cut output next year, and Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih said he was willing to cut the kingdom s production even more sharply than already promised. Oil analysts are upping their price forecasts for the commodity with $60 a barrel seen as early as this week, and $70 by mid-2017 as US shale production could take up to 12 months to increase output enough to recalibrate the dial. Goldman Sachs Group, however, expects a much quicker response from shale producers, and sees crude at $55 a barrel in the first half of next year.Bonds sell offThe yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries climbed above 2.5% for the first time since October 2014, as traders remain convinced that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates at this week&#8217;s meeting. A Bloomberg survey of economists, meanwhile, suggests the era of negative yields on 10-year German bonds may be over, with not a single respondent expecting the instrument to achieve that level between now and 2018. In China, government debt was caught up in a broad-based selloff overnight, with the one-year sovereign yield rising 15 basis points. Italian banksUniCredit&#8217;s asset sale continues, with Amundi agreeing to buy Pioneer Investments in a deal that will give the Italian lender a net capital gain of 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), lifting its common equity Tier 1 ratio by 78 basis points, the Milan-based institution said. This follows closely on the bank&#8217;s sale of a stake in Bank Pekao SA of Poland last week, providing a 55 basis points CET1 boost. Shares in Unicredit were trading 3.8% higher at 5:12am ET. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is pressing ahead with a 5 billion-euro capital increase as it tries to avoid a state rescue. It is seeking investor support for an extended debt-to-equity swap. Shares in the bank were trading 7.7% higher at 5:16am ET.Markets slipOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5%, while Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.8% to erase its losses for the year. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.4% lower at 5:25am ET as a rally in energy producers wasn&#8217;t enough to lift the wider market. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.2%. Tillerson for secretary of state?Exxon Mobil Corporation chief executive officer Rex Tillerson has emerged as President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s leading pick for the secretary of state role, with an announcement expected in the next few days. Tillerson, who has close ties to Russia, would be a controversial choice for the leading diplomatic role. Trump&#8217;s transition team was dismissive of concerns over Russian meddling in the election, saying it was time to &#8216;move on&#8217; after the big victory. 2016 Bloomberg
