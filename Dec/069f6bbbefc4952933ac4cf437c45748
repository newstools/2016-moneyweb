JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The rand slipped against the dollar on Monday, with traders expecting it to be driven mainly by global market moves as the year draws to a close.Stocks gained, led by gold producers who rebounded from steep losses the previous week as the precious metal&#8217;s spot price gained slightly.By 1515 GMT the rand was down 0.75 percent at 14.0850 per dollar compared with Friday&#8217;s New York close of 13.9800. It fell to a session low of 14.1475 earlier, mainly reflecting broad-based dollar gains against major currencies.&#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot of news coming up in the next two weeks and I think we&#8217;re going to be rangebound. But with thin liquidity the problem always is, should there be some big trades going through, the rand will go one way and people start panicking,&#8221; Treasury One dealer Andre Botha said.&#8220;My feeling is that we should watch euro/dollar and whatever euro/dollar does, rand will be a mirror image of that.&#8221;The dollar steadied close to its highest levels in 14 years, underpinned by expectations that a fiscal expansion planned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will boost inflation and lead to a faster pace of interest rates hikes.The rand is still on track to end the year up more than 9 percent versus the dollar, its first annual gain since 2010.The rebound comes after the currency tumbled last December when President Jacob Zuma changed finance ministers twice in less than a week, damaging investor confidence.On the bourse, bullion&#8217;s gains helped propel Johannesburg&#8217;s Gold Mining Index 2.10 percent higher to 1,206.17. Momentum indicators tracked by analysts suggest the sector remains oversold and could rally further this week.Gold Fields rose over 5 percent to 38.66 rand.&#8220;It looks like there is some interest in these shares because there has been a dramatic reversal in gold shares and so there could be some bargain hunting going on there. The index as a whole looks oversold,&#8221; said Ferdi Heyneke, portfolio manager at Afrifocus Securities.The benchmark Top-40 index added 0.39 percent to 43,332 while the wider All-share index climbed 0.38 percent to 48,881.In fixed income, yields eased across the curve, with the 10-year benchmark shedding 3 basis points to 8.995 percent.
