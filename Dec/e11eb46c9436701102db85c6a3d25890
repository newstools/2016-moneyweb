Nedbank, the country s fourth-largest full-service retail banking group, has held the monthly subscription pricing of its mid-market bundled bank accounts steady for 2017 (Nedbank pricing guide website). The price of its Professional Banking Bundle targeted at professionals has increased by 5.3%. Where it has increased fees, like rivals, is on its out-of-bundle (typically non-digital) and pay-as-you-use transactions.Over the past five years (including 2017), Nedbank s retail bank has increased fees in all but one (2014). It passed an average 4.3% increase in 2013, held transactional fees steady in 2014 to assist in slowing client attrition (it even made selected fee reductions in H2 2014!), increased fees by an average of 5.6% in 2015 and January this year saw another average price increase of 4.3%. That means in the last two years, prices are up over 10%, on average. It s all in the detail, though. Across those years, the price of its higher-end Savvy Bundle (i.e. Platinum account) was only increased once: by 17% in 2016. That s roughly in-line with the average increases across the period. The bank like its competitors will only increase prices of its bundled products where it has pricing power (and where this is unlikely to result in any significant churn).Nedbank Savvy BundleMonthly fee% increase2014R169N/A*2015R1690%2016R18017%2017R1800%* This account was only introduced in 2014 (in 2013, it had a Nedbank Current Account bundle not strictly comparable)The fees of most non-digital transactions have been increased. For example, a cash deposit at one of the bank s (automated) intelligent-depositor ATMs will now cost R5.50 + 70c per R100 (from R5 + 66c per R100 in 2016). Card replacement charges are up across the board (8% on Savvy, 66% on the Ke Yona Bundle and 150% on Pay-as-you-use!).Savvy BundleSavvy Plus2017201620172016Monthly feeR180R180R100R100Debit order internalFreeFreeFreeFreeDebit order externalPOS swipeFreeFreeFreeFreeWithdrawal Nedbank ATMFreeFree4 free per month**4 free per month**Withdrawal at other ATMR11.50 + R1.40 per R100R11 + R1.32 per R100R11.50 + R1.40 per R100R11 + R1.32 per R100Greenbacks linkage feeFreeFree1918Overdraft facilityFreeFree3025Cheque card service feeFreeFreeFreeFreeCash deposit at Nedbank ATM/branchR11 + R1.40 per R100R10 + R1.32 per R100R11 + R1.40 per R100R10 + R1.32 per R100Cash deposit at auto-depositorR5.50 + 70c per R100R5 + 66c per R100R5.50 + 70c per R100R5 + 66c per R100Fuel purchaseR4FreeR4FreeCard replacement feeR130R120R130R120Declined at Nedbank ATMR3.50FreeR3.50FreeDeclined at other ATMR5R5R5R5Declined at other bank POSR7.5FreeR7.5FreeDeclined debit orderR60 for first 4/year (then R150)R90 for first 3/year (then R130)R60 for first 4/year (then R150)R90 for first 3/year (then R130)** Then R4.50 + R1.40 per R100 (from R4 + R1.32 per R100)Ke Yona Bundle***Pay-as-you-use2017201620172016Monthly feeR50R50R5R5Debit order internalR5R5FreeFreeDebit order externalR9R9R5R5POS swipeFreeFreeFreeFreeWithdrawal Nedbank ATMR4 + R1.40 per R100R3 + R1.32 per R100R6.50R6Withdrawal at other ATMR11.50 + R1.40 per R100R11 + R1.32 per R100R8 + 70c per R100R7 + 66c per R100Greenbacks linkage feeN/AOverdraft facility&nbsp;*** First eight (above) Nedbank transactions per month free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheque card service feeFreeFreeR169 per yearFreeCash deposit at Nedbank ATM/branchR11 + R1.40 per R100R10 + R1.32 per R100R4 + R1.40 per R100R10Cash deposit at auto-depositorR5.50 + 70c per R100R5 + 66c per R100R2 + 70c per R100R3Fuel purchaseFreeFreeFreeFreeCard replacement feeR100R60R100R40Declined at Nedbank ATMR3.50FreeR3.50FreeDeclined at other ATMR5R5R5R3Declined at other bank POSR7.50FreeR7.50R2/R2.50 (own/other)Declined debit orderR28 (capped at 4 per month)R28 (capped at 4 per month)R10 (capped at 4 per month)R90 for first 3 per year (then R130)&nbsp;Professional Banking Bundle20172016Monthly fee299284Debit order internalFreeFreeDebit order externalR9R9POS swipeFreeFreeWithdrawal Nedbank ATMFreeFreeWithdrawal at other ATMR11.50 + R1.40 per R100R11 + R1.32 per R100Greenbacks linkage feeFreeFreeOverdraft facilityR30 (R50 over R10000)R25 (R50 over R10000)&nbsp;Cheque card service feeFreeFreeCash deposit at Nedbank ATM/branchFirst five free per monthFirst five free per monthCash deposit at auto-depositorFirst five free per monthFirst five free per monthFuel purchaseFreeFreeCard replacement feeFreeFreeDeclined at Nedbank ATMFreeFreeDeclined at other ATMR5R5Declined at other bank POSR5R2.50Declined debit orderR90 for first 3 per year (then R135)R90 for first 3 per year (then R130)Of note are the following new fees: On its two higher-end accounts (Savvy Bundle and Savvy Plus (i.e. Platinum and Gold ), Nedbank has introduced a R4 per transaction fuel purchase fee for cheque/debit cards. On the pay-as-you-use entry-level account, there is now an annual R169 cheque card service fee (free on other accounts).Credit Card FeesPlatinumGoldClassicKe Yona20172016201720162017201620172016Monthly fee****R55.40R58R30R30R24R24R55.40R57Credit facility feeR130R130R130R130Greenbucks linkage feeR19R18R19R18R19R18N/AN/AAdditional cardFreeFreeFreeFreeR24R24N/AN/AInitiation feeR188R165R188R165R188R165N/AR150**** This is a minimum amount and could be as much as R68.40On its credit cards, fees are now significantly higher following the introduction (like some of its rivals) of a credit facility fee . The bank says this covers the costs associated with providing the up to 55 days&#8217; interest-free credit card facility, routine administration and maintenance of the credit facility, as well as the cost of capital associated with providing the credit facility . Rival FNB (for one) made this move a few year or two ago. This means that, aside from Savvy Platinum Bundle customers (who don t pay any monthly or credit facility fees and are excluded from the table above), the price increases on monthly credit card fees are:These are big increases! In the fine print not in the brochures it also points out that the monthly fee is a minimum amount and may vary depending on your risk profile to a maximum of R68.40. Initiation fees across Platinum, Gold and Classic are 14% higher.* Hilton Tarrant works at immedia. He can still be contacted at hilton@moneyweb.co.za.** Banks would do better to simplify their pricing websites (we know and accept, reluctantly, that fee structures will remain unnecessarily complex). Good luck with making sense of the at least three separate PDFs you ll need for a full breakdown of fees (don t be fooled into thinking that the Everyday Banking Fees Pricing Guide is comprehensive!).
