Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s (S&amp;P) is likely to affirm South Africa s foreign currency investment grade rating and lower the country s local currency rating, says Old Mutual Investment Group SA (Omigsa).Speaking to reporters on the eve of the ratings agency s announcement, Old Mutual Investment Group&#8217;s chief economist Rian le Roux said a number of positives &#8211; which have transpired since June &#8211; may provide the ratings agency with some comfort.In June this year, S&amp;P affirmed the country s foreign currency rating at BBB-, one notch above sub-investment grade, and held the local currency rating at BBB+, well above sub-investment grade.According to him, the country s macroeconomic variables have since turned for the better, with domestic growth rebounding to 3.3% in the second quarter, after a shock contraction in the first quarter.A firmer rand, an improving inflation outlook, a narrowing current account deficit and a better global growth outlook were also labelled as positives, as was the fact that a number of expected labour disruptions did not materialise.Le Roux also highlighted National Treasury s commitment to fiscal consolidation, as outlined in October s Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, as signs that addressing issues at beleaguered State-owned entities is moving up government s priority list.The financial services firm said domestic politics appears to have turned for the better, after the fraud charges against finance minister Pravin Gordhan were dropped and strides against corruption have been made.However, S&amp;P s heavy focus on politics in its institutional assessment remains a cause for concern. S&amp;P s institutional assessment is a code word for political stability. And if they view the recent political developments in a negative manner and if they were to downgrade this from neutral, I think that would result in a [sovereign] downgrade, said Le Roux. He said other the ratings agencies look at the democratic system of governance, the strength of the National Treasury, central bank, judiciary and banks, as well as the independence of the media when assessing institutional risk. S&amp;P is expected to cut the country s local currency rating, which appears to be out of kilter with its own foreign currency assessment as well as that of the other ratings agencies. Source: Omigsa If you want to find a reason to lower it, you look at the interest payment as a percent of total government spend, which has crept up from 8% to 10%. That alone is enough to downgrade it and I fully expect them to cut the local rating, said Le Roux.He added that a lower local currency rating, which still falls within the investment grade band, is unlikely to have much of an impact.For South Africa to fall out of the World Government Index, two ratings agencies need to cut the local currency rating to sub-investment grade. That is not going to happen anytime soon. If that happens, the ratings agencies say we think you re not going to be able to repay your local government debt and that is just not on, he said. Both Moody s and Fitch affirmed the country s investment grade ratings last week.
