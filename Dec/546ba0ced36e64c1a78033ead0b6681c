 Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.ECB dayThe European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 7:45am ET, with President Mario Draghi holding a press conference at 8:30am in which he&#8217;s expected to outline the plans for the bank&#8217;s asset-purchase program, currently due to end in March 2017 at the earliest. The ECB will also publish updated growth and inflation forecasts, including a first look at 2019. Not a single economist in the Bloomberg survey forecasts a rate change today, but expectations for an extension to the QE programme has helped lift stocks and bonds in recent sessions. Silver riggingPlaintiffs say documents relating to a lawsuit that claim Deutsche Bank manipulated gold and silver prices, which it settled, provide smoking gun proof that UBS Group, HSBC Holdings, Bank of Nova Scotia and others rigged the silver market. The documents show communication between traders in different banks discussing ways to affect the market. Separately, an audit commissioned by German regulators suggest that Deutsche Bank employees may have manipulated internal indexes as part of a scheme to help Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena conceal losses. Shares in Deutsche Bank were 1.4% higher at 17.59 at 5:26am ET, approaching a 16% gain this week. Russian oil saleCommodity trader Glencore Plc and Qatar s sovereign wealth fund have agreed to buy a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, for 10.2-billion euro ($11 billion). For Glencore, the deal will increase the amount of oil it has to trade by 220 000 barrels a day. In Russia, the cash from the sale will go into a holding company nominally owned by the government, rather than directly to the finance ministry. Shares in Glencore were 1 percent higher at 5:19am ET, bringing the company&#8217;s 2016 rally to 240%. Markets rise Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8% and Japan&#8217;s Topix index climbed 1.1% as markets took their lead from US benchmarks which climbed to new record closing highs. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.2% higher at 5:24am ET as investors await the ECB decision. S&amp;P 500 futures were broadly unchanged. China exportsThe cheaper yuan helped spur a surprise 0.1% gain in China&#8217;s exports, ending a seven-month losing streak. While exports are expected to continue to rise in 2017, there is a risk from US trade policy, which is &#8220;the big unknown&#8221; according to Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg Intelligence in Beijing. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan unexpectedly cut its reading of third-quarter economic growth to an annualised 1.3%, from a preliminary estimate of 2.2% expansion, blaming a drop in business spending and private inventories. 2016 Bloomberg
