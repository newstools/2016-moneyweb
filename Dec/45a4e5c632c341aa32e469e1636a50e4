The board of the Nova Property Group, the rescue vehicle of the erstwhile Sharemax property syndication group, last week sent at least two communications to its 31 000 debenture holders in an attempt to calm down many of them who have been disturbed by Moneyweb s recent revelations.The Nova board came out swinging by claiming that the articles are negative, biased and mostly incorrect , and refers debenture holders to the correct information that appears on the Frontier website. Read the full statement here.These communications followed the publication of several Moneyweb articles in recent weeks about how the four Nova directors have managed to secure 87.1% of the shareholding and 91% of the voting rights in Nova without paying a cent.This was revealed when Nova opened its shareholder registers to Moneyweb after the board fought for more than three years in various courts to keep the a secret.The directors dominant shareholding also made it possible for them to pay themselves exorbitant salaries, whilst the board also recently announced that all interest payments to debenture holders were suspended.The Nova board also said in the communication that the negative media reports are regrettable, especially having regard to the inordinate amount of time and effort that the Group has invested in sharing correct and detailed information with relevant media, as appears from the information contained on the Frontier website .This is not quite accurate, as the board s reference to an inordinate amount of time actually refers to one physical meeting lasting around 90 minutes at which the board opened the shareholder registers to Moneyweb, and then answering three sets of emailed questions. Nova CEO Dominique Haese also gave a radio interview. Unfortunately, the board does not disclose that it terminated all communication with Moneyweb prior to the publication of the first article and did not find the time to answer three additional sets of questions.Here are the questions Nova did not answer. One, two, three.Nova s responseDespite the Nova board s response and accusations of incorrect reporting, the board offers no new reasons to counter the serious allegations Moneyweb makes. In fact, Nova only republishes the transcript of the Haese/RSG interview, and the emailed questions and answers between Moneyweb and the board that have already been published on Moneyweb.There is no official response or additional information from the board to refute Moneyweb s information.Below appear 24 indisputable facts related to the Nova directors, how they managed to capture a dominant shareholding in the company and how this shareholding has influenced their decision making.100%&nbsp;Nova suspended all communication with Moneyweb.Here is an earlier response from Haese confirming this:Dear Mr van Niekerk,It is regrettable that our efforts in engaging Moneyweb openly, constructively and in a bona vide fashion has not been reciprocated. In response Moneyweb has chosen to publish articles without prior reference to us, and in breach of your undertaking to allow us to see and comment on the articles first, which articles twist the facts, articulate a number of inaccuracies and untruths and seek to slander and defame the Nova Group and its directorate. We are considering our position and our rights in this regard are reserved.It has become clear to us that any information that is provided by us to Moneyweb, will be twisted and used out of context for the purpose of further negative reporting of and concerning the Nova Group and its directorate and given that no further productive purpose would be served in engaging with Moneyweb, the Nova Group has decided to break off all forms of communication with Moneyweb. We will accordingly no longer respond to questions Moneyweb pose to us, requests for commentary on proposed articles or for that matter to any articles that Moneyweb might publish, subject of course to a reservation of the right to deal with any matter Moneyweb might publish, in a court of law.Please ensure, should you elect to publish anything further regarding the Nova Group and any of its functionaries, that you include in such publication our above position, verbatim.Yours faithfully,Dominique HaeseCEO Nova Property Group
