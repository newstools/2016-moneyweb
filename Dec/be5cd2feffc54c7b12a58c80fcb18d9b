JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s downgraded South Africa &#8216;s local debt by one notch to BBB on Friday but kept the country&#8217;s sovereign credit rating unchanged at BBB-, one level above &#8220;junk&#8221; status, while saying the economy was still struggling.S&amp;P retained its negative outlook on the sovereign unchanged, it said in a statement. The rand gained more than 1.5% against the dollar after the ratings release.About 90% of South Africa &#8216;s R2.4 trillion ($173 billion) debt is held in local currency, and the cut could see the country fall out of global bond indices, preventing institutional investors from buying its debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
