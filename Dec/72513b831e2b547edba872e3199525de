Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Fed hikeAs expected, the Federal Open Markets Committee decided to increase rates by 25 basis points yesterday. The market reaction, which saw Bloomberg&#8217;s Dollar Spot Index surge 1.1% by the end of the day, was driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s updated dot-plot which is predicting a faster than previously expected rate of tightening next year. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries reached more than 2.6% this morning as futures show a greater than 50% chance of the next hike coming in May 2017. Gold was also hit, dropping to $1 137 an ounce by 5:07am ET., while the rising dollar put emerging market assets on the defensive.BOE, SNB and Norges BankAt 7:00am ET the Bank of England will announce its latest monetary policy decision. While expectations are for no change to rates or the size of the asset-purchase facility, investors will be looking for signs of increasing pressure from inflation hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee. Ahead of that announcement, retail sales in the UK unexpectedly increased 0.2% in November, the Office for National Statistics said. The Swiss National Bank maintained an unchanged policy stance, also as expected, while warning of a &#8220;multitude of political uncertainties&#8221; in Europe in 2017. Norway&#8217;s central bank also maintained rates, surprising markets by not lowering its rate outlook and sparking a surge in the krone this morning.

Overnight the yield on the country&#8217;s 10-year sovereign debt surged by 22 basis points, the most on record, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped 2.3%.
