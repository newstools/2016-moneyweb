Homeowners expecting that their residential properties will deliver inflation-beating house price growth this year are in for a rude awakening, as house prices will likely languish in the low single-digits.The recovery of SA s residential property market since the 2008 financial crisis has been at a glacial pace, with house prices barely keeping up with inflation over the past five years.And the outlook doesn t look promising with several property punters downgrading their 2016 nominal (not adjusted for inflation) house price forecasts to 3% to 4% from the 5% initially touted in January.Weak economic growth, interest rates that have risen by 200 basis points since the hiking cycle began in January 2014, low consumer confidence, and heightened political uncertainty are some of the factors weighing on the residential market.

The Western Cape began its strong performance in the middle of 2012, outperforming all provinces.Four years later, the Western Cape is still showing price growth of 10.5% year-on-year for the third quarter of 2016 compared with Gauteng s paltry 2.1% according to FNB s latest data. Even when inflation is factored in, the province is still showing positive growth of 4.2%.The Western Cape s performance has been fuelled by the steady movement of people to the region from other parts of SA, mainly Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Also, the perception that the Mother City is the best-run metro in terms of service delivery, the lifestyle offering and good government-run schools is a big drawing card. In fact, so hard have property prices accelerated in the Western Cape that it has emerged as the most expensive region to purchase a property. Buyers in the province are having to shell out R239 568 more on average for a similar sized property than in Gauteng and R268 230 in KwaZulu-Natal (see average house prices below).Source: FNBA closer look at the performance of individual cities reveals that Cape Town is still a leader for the second quarter of 2016 with house price growth of more than 13% vs 4% for Johannesburg, data from property research firm Lightstone (See graph below for other regions).Source: Lightstone Some analysts don t expect the Western Cape s momentum to continue at the same level as in the past four years. There are already signs of property sales/transfer volumes in the region slowing down, with a decrease in volumes from highs of 7 511 in February this year to 1 926 in November, according to deeds registry data.Cape Town hotspots Pam Golding Property group CEO Andrew Golding says the increased demand and limited supply of properties in Cape Town have protected the city from the variations in house prices.He adds that the Atlantic Seaboard Clifton, the V&amp;A Waterfront and Bantry Bay in particular have significantly benefitted from the migration trend with apartments in some cases selling for up to a staggering R140 000 per square metre. In the past, a sale in excess of R100 000 per square metre was a rarity. We now regularly see prices exceeding this benchmark. Golding says even free-standing homes in the Atlantic Seaboard are commanding eye-watering valuations, with the average selling price escalating to R14.4 million in the year to October 2016.Seeff chairman Samuel Seeff says buying in the Atlantic seaboard is now reserved for people who are going to pay a lot more for fewer square metres than they might be able to acquire in other periphery suburbs. If they are looking for value, they are not going to get it on a square metre basis in the City Bowl, Seeff tells Moneyweb.Selling a property in Cape Town is quicker than in Johannesburg, with the duration of a well-priced property for sale being four to six weeks whereas in Johannesburg it s double or three times that duration .For buyers who cannot afford the City Bowl or Atlantic Seaboard and still want to enjoy the benefits of living close to the city, Seeff says Woodstock, one of Cape Town s oldest suburb which has undergone extensive rejuvenation to become a trendy area with art galleries, designer boutiques and acclaimed restaurants, has offered buyers value.Golding agrees with Seeff saying another alternative that has seen wide demand is Blouberg and the West Coast. Buyers are also relocating to the Western Cape are also settling in other urban areas such as Paarl, Somerset West and Stellenbosch, and along the coastline, says Golding.The old money Garden Route and Winelands notably Stellenbosch, Franschhoek and Paarl are a hit, with the average price of homes in Stellenbosch surpassing R6 million.
