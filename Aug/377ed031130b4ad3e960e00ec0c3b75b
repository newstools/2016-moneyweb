If you are worried that you are not saving enough for your retirement, chances are, you aren t the only one. The majority of young people save very little or, in some cases, nothing at all for their future lives.Psychologists say that it&#8217;s because the future doesn&#8217;t seem real to them. They live just for today.Even though the stats are improving, the savings rate in general is still quite low. According to a survey by the South African Savings Institute (Sasi), the country&#8217;s official savings rate at the end of March was 15%; the household savings rate 1.1% and debt as a percentage of disposable income a staggering 76.6%.By nature, younger people are not good at saving and at 18 they are not thinking about retirement. The latest Stats SA report reveals that the unemployment rate in the second quarter dropped slightly with 0.1 of a percentage point to 26.6%.If you consider this figure along with the fact that the country has a young population, it helps explain why people don&#8217;t save.Sasi attributes the low rate of saving amongst the youth to a lack of financial literacy, not understanding financial products and the culture of consumerism.Stats from the South African National Treasury show that only 6% of South Africans will be able to maintain their standard of living after retirement. The future youIn an experiment with Glacier by Sanlam, three individuals were selected to talk about what their perfect life would entail after retirement. Each were shown a short film depicting them living out their future aspirations. They were then each told how much income they d have in retirement, based on their current savings structure, and asked if they could live the way they aspired to. None of them could. By connecting them to their ideal future and showing them the inadequacy of their savings they were motivated to take action in the present.&#8220;You can do the same thing at home, even though you don&#8217;t have an entire video production. If you want to progress in life, you need to know where you are and that is the first step to any goal. Then take action,&#8221; says motivational speaker Justin Cohen, who worked with the individuals (one of whom, Deon Koch, is pictured with him below).Cohen says that when planning for your financial wellbeing it&#8217;s best to visualise yourself in the future. He suggests thinking about your future self,&#8217; and not the person you see in the mirror.&#8220;The reason people don&#8217;t save is that when they think about their future self, it seems as though they are thinking of someone else,&#8221; says Cohen.The ability to think of a future you&#8217; is not natural. The problem with imagining your older self&#8217; is that the concept does not seem real. To Cohen, the &#8216;current self &#8216;has all the power. The future self is far off in an entirely different time and space called the future . If you are not saving sufficiently in the present, you are giving the &#8216;future self&#8217; little power with your current actions.Hal Hershfield, a professor based at UCLA&#8217;s Anderson School of Management in the US, conducted an experiment to help participants imagine what they would look like in their golden years. According to his findings, people who see digitally-altered images of themselves as senior citizens are far more willing to save more for retirement than those who don&#8217;t.&#8220;That&#8217;s the key here. People need to have a vision for themselves because most of us are just going through the day without a compelling picture of the future,&#8221; says Cohen.Another issue is that immediate gratification can be very tempting. The understanding is: you only live once (or yolo as they say), so you spend your money now because you can&#8217;t be sure you will be around tomorrow to enjoy it.In the past people didn&#8217;t live for very long and thinking about a retirement income was not a priority. In South Africa, life expectancy has improved. Recent figures by Stats SA show that life expectancy at birth is estimated at 65.1 years for females and 59.7 years for males.Compared with last year, the life expectancy for males fell marginally from 60.6 years but increased somewhat for females from 64.3 years. Stats SA points out that the country s life expectancy of 62.4 years still falls short of the target age of 70 set in the National Development Plan.According to the World Health Organisation, some of the factors contributing to the increase in longevity include a drop in infant mortality, access to clean water and better control of infectious diseases.Start nowAlthough it is never too late to start saving, there are many reasons why it is vital to start soonest. If you start saving as soon as you earn an income, you can take advantage of compound interest.Cohen acknowledges that some days will be tough and one can make the wrong decision. He says taking responsibility and moving on will help when you stumble along the way. Increasing your monthly savings can assist in making up for the shortfall. There are plenty of distractions that will pull us away from our plans, and I think most people don&#8217;t give up on their goals, they just forget about them.
