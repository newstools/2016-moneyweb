 The potential of private equity investments continues in Africa, despite the continent s lower GDP growth rates and the effects of falling commodity prices on commodity-rich countries.While Africa has lost some of its shine the fundamentals remain and support private equity opportunities. But finding the right potential partners takes more on-the-ground research and pounding of the pavements than applying macro-economic data and office analysis.Although some way off from their heyday, Africa s growth rates are still some of the highest in the world, while a large population of under 18s and some of the globe s fastest growing populations are attractive for consumer goods, textiles and other consumer-related industries. A rising population is driving demand for better public services and infrastructure, resulting in investment opportunities in industries such as healthcare, education and construction, as well as railway and energy projects. Low electricity consumption per capita, few paved roads and often below par broadband and banking penetration all create opportunities highlighted by some recent private equity investments in accommodation, hospitality and leisure, logistics, and manufacturing.In addition, more sophisticated legislative frameworks and a growing desire for democracy, as well as low private equity penetration, contribute to the positive fundamentals providing an attractive environment for the private equity investor.In East Africa, as an example, political conflicts in the region are no longer the norm as the rise of democracy becomes more common &#8211; Kenya has had regular elections over the last two decades.Capital is able to flow freely in and out of East Africa, foreign ownership of investments is allowed and security of investment is guaranteed under the constitution in most East African regions. Businesses are mostly well capitalised and have access to debt markets though some have over-geared balance sheets, offering a source of opportunities for private equity. Kenya is a signatory to major international investment protection agreements such as those with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Added to this, Africa has an abundance of entrepreneurs who have no shortage of entrepreneurial experience but rather a lack of management expertise. Some are under strain to attract capital while others are looking for help with formalising structures and expanding across borders. Typically, the founders or next generation of a family business are often not well equipped for succession or the next period of growth.These issues provide an ideal opportunity for private equity companies, which can offer governance advice, share networks and provide funds. However the ability to do proprietary deals is limited as some sellers see private equity merely as a source of cash, rather than a long-term partnership; while the increased presence of foreign private equity companies has led to too much capital chasing too few deals.In any country, good economic growth and a pipeline of successful entrepreneurial businesses does not always mean fast and high returns. While some opportunities present quicker returns than others, most require patience and potentially deep pockets. Private equity deals have typically extended over three to six years, often not enough to meet the expectations of sellers who do not see sufficient value added over that time. Deals are consequently becoming longer in duration.Large deals are also scarce with deal size falling into the US$2 million to $15 million space, though a new phase of exits should see this range increase. Market illiquidity is also a deterrent as stock markets are often poorly traded and unsophisticated, hampering listings as an exit solution; a structured exit is often a better alternative. Also, insufficient local pension fund endorsement of private equity exists, adding to illiquidity problems.Other risks include exchange controls and fluid legislative frameworks making it difficult to litigate while corruption is rife across the continent, though it is being addressed and discussed publicly. Terror threats in many regions remain a concern for investors, while weakening local currencies against the dollar have become a major deterrent and have left some deals vulnerable to currency risk; although in countries such as Kenya, which is less reliant on a commodity driven economy, the local currency is far more stable.Ultimately the fundamentals of the continent and its countries, as well as the framework in which investors and their investments need to operate, continue to play a role in private equity investment decisions. But more importantly, a good investment depends on paying a reasonable price for a strong company with a robust cash flow and market position, good growth prospects, and an effective management team. Businesses like these are able to manage economic downturns and the risks associated with Africa, and investments in them usually result in attractive, long-term returns for all partners.Paul Boynton is chief executive at Old Mutual Alternative Investments
