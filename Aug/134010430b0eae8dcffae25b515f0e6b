CAPE TOWN The Financial Services Board (FSB) has confirmed that its investigation into certain aspects of the local operations of international financial consultancy deVere is nearing a conclusion. The regulator told Moneyweb that it is expecting to receive a final report on the matter very soon.The first indication that deVere was being investigated in South Africa came from the Financial Times in the UK, which reported last year that the FSB was scrutinising the consultancy&#8217;s local business.At the time, deVere spokesman George Prior told Moneyweb that this investigation was related solely to a fund platform that had been authorised by the previous head of deVere South Africa. This FSB enquiry is solely based on the structure of the platform and nothing else, he said.However, Moneyweb has seen a copy of a summons issued to someone who gave evidence in the course of the investigation, and there is no mention of this fund platform among the numerous areas on which they were asked to provide information. Last month Moneyweb also learnt that deVere&#8217;s CEO Nigel Green had been subpoenaed to appear before the FSB&#8217;s investigators to provide evidence in its enquiries into deVere. This was confirmed by the regulator itself.When Moneyweb approached deVere for comment, however, the company spokesman, George Prior, had a very different explanation: Nigel Green recently spoke with the FSB in regard to the regulator s specific investigation into the Strategic Growth Fund, which was administered by the Mauritius-based Belvedere Management Group, Prior noted. Last year deVere, which was just one of the many leading banks and consultancies that was initially attracted to this fund, was instrumental in exposing to the regulators, legal authorities and the media in South Africa and globally, the alleged wrongdoing of the administrators of this fund. Since then deVere has been actively working with legal authorities and regulators, among others, to try and recover the lost value for its clients in this matter. DeVere welcomes the FSB s investigation and will continue to assist the regulator as well as using our resources and best endeavours to help bring this situation to a satisfactory close for our clients. This FSB investigation relates solely to the SGF and not deVere. When Moneyweb asked whether Prior was saying that the FSB is not investigating deVere, his response was: Investigations into the reporting of Belvedere Management Group and the Strategic Growth Fund have been going on for 12 months. DeVere has been assisting the FSB, the Guernsey Regulator and the administrators and will continue to do so. Whilst deVere has only been affected by a relatively small percentage of the problems believed to be caused by Belvedere, we will continue to do all we can to help the FSB, and other regulators worldwide. As you know, Nigel Green and deVere have been instrumental in highlighting the alleged wrongdoing by those behind Belvedere to the legal authorities and regulators, after the initial expos in early 2015 made them aware of the potential wrongdoing. They remain committed to actively working alongside the authorities in order to try and recover lost value for deVere clients. The FSB was however unequivocal. Deputy executive officer at the FSB, Caroline da Silva, who requested the investigation into deVere, told Moneyweb: Mr Green has been providing us with evidence under subpoena. He was a director and ostensibly in control at the relevant time, and therefore he is as a person of interest in the deVere inspection. This is a completely separate matter to any enquiries into Belvedere. He was not assisting us with other inspections and the matter does not involve any other regulators. We have a completely separate investigation into deVere itself.
