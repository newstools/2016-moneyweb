CAPE TOWN On Tuesday the Association for Savings and Investment SA (Asisa) released its quarterly statistics on the local unit collective investment scheme (CIS) industry. At the end of June there was R1.96 trillion invested in South African domiciled funds, in 1 403 different portfolios.Just under R1 trillion of this money, or 51%, is invested in multi-asset funds. This compares to 24% in interest bearing portfolios, and 21% in equity funds.Over the past year, there has also been a net inflow of R22.6 billion into multi-asset funds, while equity funds have seen net outflows of R5.1 billion.Broadly speaking this is not surprising. Local investors have shown a very clear preference for multi-asset funds over the past decade.At the end of June 2006 there was only R82 billion invested in South African asset allocation funds as they were then called. The South Africa multi-asset categories now hold more than ten times that at R887 billion.Over the same period, assets in South African equity funds have only grown from R131 billion to R360 billion.Equity vs multi-assetCommenting on these latest statistics, senior policy advisor at Asisa, Sunette Mulder, pointed out that by opting overwhelmingly for multi-asset offerings, investors have actually shown some astute judgement. Over the past 20 years South African multi-asset high equity funds have delivered returns not that far behind South African equity funds. And they have done this at significantly lower risk.This raises an interesting discussion, because it is worth examining exactly what this means. As a starting point, the table below gives a comparison of the average returns earned by funds in the South African equity general and South African multi-asset high equity categories over the past two decades.Comparison of CIS category returnsCategory5 years10 years15 years20 yearsSA equity general11.49%11.18%15.58%14.45%SA multi-asset high equity11.46%10.13%12.54%13.22%FTSE/JSE All Share Index13.81%12.62%15.75%14.46%Figures shown are annualised total returns.Source: MorningstarIt is worth taking this analysis a bit further. The table below shows the range of returns investors could have experienced in these two categories by showing the performance of the best and worst performing funds over each time period.Comparison of range of returns within CIS category returnsCategory5 years10 years15 years20 yearsSA equity general top performer19.78%14.99%20.95%16.65%SA equity general worst performer-1.87%4.99%12.79%10.15%SA multi-asset high equity top performer16.70%14.52%16.55%15.46%SA multi-asset high equity worst performer0.74%5.58%9.36%12.50%Figures shown are annualised total returns.Source: MorningstarThese two tables together create an interesting picture. It is clear that there are not huge differences between these categories. It is only over the 15-year time period that there is meaningful divergence and equity funds show clear outperformance.One should keep in mind, however, that there are only 34 equity general funds and 12 multi-asset high equity funds with track records that stretch back that long. So the data set is fairly limited.Over the past ten years, which allows for a more comprehensive analysis, the returns generated by funds in these two categories look very similar. Over five years the average returns are essentially the same, although equity funds have shown a much broader spread of returns.The lessonsInvestors looking at these numbers should consider three things.The first is that multi-asset funds offer a very distinct benefit in being able to give you returns almost on par with equity funds, but with much smoother performance. The advantage of that is that it is easier to make the decision to stay invested if you are experiencing less volatility.The second argument in favour of multi-asset funds is that the worst performance you could experience in this category will almost always be better than the worst performance you might get from an equity fund. This is true over all time periods apart from the anomaly over 15 years. Even then, though, the spread of performance between the best and worst multi-asset fund is smaller than that between the best and worst equity fund.However, the evidence is still that equity funds will deliver better inflation-beating returns over the long term. Even if you only take the 20 year number, the average equity fund grew by 1.23% per year more than the average multi-asset fund.That might not sound like a lot, but if you compound it over 20 years, it becomes significant, as the table below shows:Value of R100 000 invested at June 30 1996In an average equity fund at 14.45%R1.487 millionIn an average multi-asset high equity fund at 13.22%R1.198 millionOver this period, the money in the average equity fund is worth 25% more.This shows that if you can live with the extra volatility, investing in equities is still the better option. And you can even do this without the hassle of trying to select the right manager, because as the first table indicated, just investing in the index would have given you the same return as the average equity manager over the past two decades.
