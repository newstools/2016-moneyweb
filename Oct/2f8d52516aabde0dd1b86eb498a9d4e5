MTN Group Ltd. shares slumped to a six-year low after a Nigerian lawmaker claimed the wireless carrier may have illegally moved more than the previously estimated $14 billion out of the country, citing early findings from an investigation into the allegation.The stock declined as much as 3.2% to R106.47 in Johannesburg, the lowest since July 2010, and traded down 2.25% to R107.50 at the close in Johannesburg. We have realised from preliminary investigations that it is actually outrageously higher than the original figure, Dino Melaye, the senator who raised the allegation last month, told reporters in the capital, Abuja, on Wednesday. International forensic experts, accountants and lawyers are also involved in the probe and are examining documents dating back 16 years, said Senator Rafiu Ibrahim, chairman of the committee that s leading the inquiry.MTN, Africa s biggest wireless carrier by sales, has denied the claims. The company, the central bank and four lenders were scheduled to attend an investigative hearing into the matter on Thursday.The probe is taking place about four months after MTN agreed to pay a 330 billion naira ($1.1 billion) fine in cash to the Nigerian government and list its local unit on the country s stock exchange after about eight months of negotiations. That penalty was imposed for missing a deadline to disconnect 5.1 million customers unregistered in the country, which is battling an Islamist insurgency.The stock has almost halved since the fine was first reported a year ago, allowing crosstown rival Vodacom Group Ltd. to overtake the company in terms of market valuation. MTN has appointed Vodafone Group Plc s Rob Shuter as CEO. He is due to join the company before July.
