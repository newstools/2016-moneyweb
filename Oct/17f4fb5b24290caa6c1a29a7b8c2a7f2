JOHANNESBURG Despite a tendency to procrastinate and an allergic reaction to paperwork, I ve always prided myself on the fact that my finances are well managed.So when a financial wellness assessment gave me a score of 3 out of 5 and suggested attention [is] required I was taken aback.The financial wellness tool in question has been developed by ZAQ Consultants &amp; Actuaries to evaluate the financial situation of individuals holistically. A free assessment, which requires you to answer four sets of questions about your debt, savings, insurance and financial stewardship, is done online and a four-page report flags areas of concern in each category (if any). An average financial wellness score is also supplied.Niel Fourie, actuary at ZAQ, says good financial advisors often require clients to have at least R1 million or more in assets or to earn a big salary, which leaves a missing middle who struggle to access financial advice. This would typically include people who earn between R5 000 and R30 000 a month who haven t saved a lot of money and who are most likely to be over-indebted.He says the pending introduction of the Retail Distribution Review in South Africa will most likely make it more difficult for people with a relatively low income to access financial advice. The tool is an effort to make it more affordable to South Africans to access advice through their employers.While the tool itself offers standardised guidance, the results shouldn t be taken as financial advice, Fourie cautions. So based on this you can now speak to a financial advisor or you can do some research online to see where you should improve. In line with other research, feedback thus far generally suggests that many South Africans are over-indebted and under-insured.Fourie says in their opinion debt, savings, insurance and financial stewardship are the most important areas of a financial plan that need to be considered.The tool is not aimed at high net worth individuals with very specific financial requirements or intricate trust structures, but about 90% of South Africans would be pretty much fine if they score well in all these areas, he argues.Why I scored so badlyWhile I didn t score too badly on the debt and savings assessments ( room for improvement or 4 out of 5) the algorithm flagged my life and disability insurance as a pay attention now area. This is probably because the input doesn t allow you to select a lump sum as well as a monthly income option with regard to disability and doesn t consider alternative risk benefits. Also, because I don t have any dependents my life insurance only covers my outstanding bond, which I believe is adequate. I played around with the inputs a bit, but the report continues to flag this area as a concern.But on financial stewardship there were definitely some areas of concern.I don t have a will, my family members don t know where my policies are kept and I don t test the price of my insurance with other providers on a regular basis. The assessment flagged all these areas for urgent attention.Interestingly, it also highlighted the fact that I don t save for my children s education (despite me not having any).Fourie says even if you are not married but think you might have kids, it is a good time to start providing for your children s education sooner rather than later. It depends on your own personal circumstances but it is just a flag for you to consider even if you know you are not going to do anything about it now. My thoughtsThe tool is easy to use and the assessment can be completed within five to 10 minutes, provided you have some numbers on hand (the value of outstanding debt, long-term and emergency savings and insurance cover). The report is generated immediately and the feedback doesn t require an advanced level of financial knowledge.The assumptions used in the algorithm seem to be on the conservative side, which is good. Even though I have diligently saved 15% of my salary towards retirement since I started working, the report noted that there was room for improvement in this area.Fourie says even where individuals do save 15% of their salaries in an occupational pension fund each month, some of this may be allocated towards risk benefits and if costs are 1%, only around 10 or 11% may eventually enter the retirement pot. All else being equal, this would reduce the benefits individuals would receive in retirement.The algorithm targets a 100% replacement ratio (in other words, your pension would be able to replace your last salary in full), which would require members to save in excess of 20% of their monthly salary towards retirement (depending on investment return and period assumptions).While the industry standard is generally to target 75%, in the context of increasing longevity it is probably prudent to aim for a higher percentage.According to the tool s privacy policy, an individual s personal data is not stored or seen by anyone only the algorithm accesses the data (although it can access the feedback report).There is arguably some room for improvement with regards to the phrasing of certain questions in the initial assessment. In the debt section for example, individuals are asked how many store cards they have and what the estimated monthly payments entail. While the assumption is that the required figure will be total payments (collectively for all accounts) there is some ambiguity and individuals could mistakenly opt to only disclose the average installment per account, skewing the results.The disability input may also be slightly too simplistic to really get a sense of whether your insurance is sufficient.Generally speaking though, the tool does highlight the importance of the various building blocks for financial wellness and can offer valuable insights into areas that may require attention.
