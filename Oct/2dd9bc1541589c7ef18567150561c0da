JOHANNESBURG Political turmoil and fears that South Africa s sovereign credit rating could be downgraded to junk status have been tough on local banks.In the wake of Nenegate, the share prices of banking stocks collapsed in a heap. They also came under pressure when the NPA announced that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would be charged with fraud, albeit to a lesser extent.Peter Linley, head of equities and manager of the Old Mutual Investors Fund, says banks suffer during a confidence crisis. These companies are in the business of taking on risk and lending into the economy, and bond yields, which typically spike during these times, are used to discount valuations.While there may still be some spike in yields or weakness in the currency if South Africa is downgraded, to a large extent, banking share prices and bond yields are already discounting a lot of the bad news, he argues.The chart below demonstrates his view on Barclays Africa in a bear, base and bull case scenario. About 5.5% of the Old Mutual Investors Fund is invested in Barclays Africa. The share price closed at R147.25 on Monday.In its base case scenario, to which it assigns a 50% probability, South Africa s credit rating is downgraded, bonds yields don t move significantly and there are some job losses but no major blowouts, fair value for the share is R194.In a bear case scenario, to which it assigns a 30% probability, South Africa gets downgraded, bond yields spike and GDP growth slows, it values the company at R162 a share.This means that there is still a potential 10% upside to the company s share price, even in a worst case scenario.Barclays has been doing a lot of consolidation, has improved the quality of its book and is now in a position to grow the business, he says.Source: Old Mutual EquitiesIn the least likely scenario, in which South Africa keeps its investment grade rating, interest rates move lower and GDP growth improves, fair value is R213 a share, which represents a potential 45% upside to current trading levels.Linley says all of the big four banks currently offer potential upside even in a worst case scenario although percentages differ.About 12% of the Investors Fund, which celebrates its 50th birthday this week, is invested in banks. This is about 3 percentage points higher than the benchmark weight.Its other bank holdings include Standard Bank and Nedbank. While it had a significant holding in FirstRand for a long time, it sold its position as it saw relatively better value Barclays, Standard Bank and Nedbank, he says. We still think that there is value now in FirstRand, we just think that there is more value in these three. While they have increased the fund s exposure to banks since Nenegate and there may still be some scope to increase its overall exposure to banks by another percentage point, they wouldn t go much higher.Banks are subject to economic cycles and could again come under pressure should there be a global shock or if interest rates went up significantly, he says.
