Comair, which operates the SLOW Lounge brand for partners including British Airways and FNB, will open a new concept “SLOW XS Lounge” at Lanseria International Airport in December. It announced this in the group’s annual report, released last week. Comair says the lounge “will be smaller than, but similar in quality to, the SLOW Lounges”. Its liquor licence application reveals the lounge will be situated on the first floor, in the “pier extension to the Lanseria Main Terminal Building”. Demand for the lounges – which the group argues have set a global standard – continues to increase, and the lounge at Cape Town International Airport was “extended and refurbished” in 2014, roughly doubling in size. During the past financial year, a sum of R23 million was invested to extend and upgrade the lounge in the international departures area at OR Tambo International Airport. This extension has allowed Comair “the opportunity to allow other international airlines, who have contracted with the Group, the opportunity to experience the SLOW concept”. These include Air France, KLM and alliance partner Delta, with whom the group operates a codeshare agreement (via its kulula.com brand and route network). It’s solidly profitable On a profit basis, Comair ranks satisfactorily globally. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast a profit per passenger of $9.31 globally in 2015, with a small improvement in the number for 2016 (at $9.59). But, these figures are heavily distorted by North American airlines, where IATA sees profits at $21-$22 per passenger. African airlines are forecast to make a loss of nearly $4 per passenger in 2015, with a big jump to a loss of 93¢ in 2016. On a net margin basis, it saw the global figure being 4.6% in 2015 and 5.1% in 2016. On this basis, Comair performed very well. Profits have improved and while they’re not quite back at the near record levels enjoyed in the 2014 financial year, yield has improved with a meaningful increase in the number of passengers per flight (125 from 120). The downward pressure on airfares in a sharply lower oil price environment (and a more competitive market) is plain to see.

Non-airline operations an increasing contributor Comair’s non-airline businesses, which “comprises the travel business, property investments, [flight] simulator business, Slow Lounges and Slow in the City” are forming a larger portion of group revenue and – importantly – profits. Roughly R1 out of every R5 earned as profit by the group is from these non-airline businesses, despite these only generating R4 out of every R100 in revenue. Just five years ago, the non-airline units contributed R49 million in revenue (1.4%). Fleet renewal done Comair’s current phase of its fleet renewal programme is all but complete. In the year to end-June, it “took delivery of three new 737-800s from Boeing”. The remaining aircraft from this current order of eight “is scheduled for delivery in November 2016”. “In addition to having delivered substantial fuel savings of between 6% and 7% compared to the B737-400 fleet,” says Comair, “the new aircraft have a greater revenue generating potential with their increased seating capacity and they also require less maintenance downtime. It is estimated that the Boeing 737-800 New Generation aircraft with its greater seating capacity burns 33% less fuel per passenger than the older and smaller Boeing 737-400.” Its order for another eight Boeing 737-8 Max (the replacement for the 737-800) “remains scheduled for 2019 to 2021. Comair owns 19 aircraft and leases six: 14 of these are the new generation Boeing 737-800s, with the remaining 11 being older Boeing 737-400s. Over time, it intends to upgrade its entire fleet to 737-800s (and its successor, the next generation 737-8 Max). E-commerce king Comair estimates kulula.com to be “South Africa’s largest online retailer by annual sales value”. Beyond this, it says that together with partner Europcar, it is the “largest online seller of car rental in South Africa”. It invested R52 million in the implementation of “a business-wide airline enterprise system from Sabre Airline Solutions in June 2012” and notes that the group continues to “improve the system with new modules and updated technology”. Comair says Sabre “has and will continue to deliver substantial improvements in revenue integrity, inventory management and optimised ticket pricing, as well as improved crew and airport staff productivity”. One safety-related incident In the year under review, Comair reported one safety-related incident. On October 26 2015, a Boeing 737-400 operating under the British Airways brand “suffered damage after the left-hand main landing gear detached from the aircraft after landing at OR Tambo International Airport”. It was operating between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg and had “94 passengers and six crew members on board”. Comair says “all the passengers and crew safely exited the aircraft and none of the passengers or crew suffered any injuries”. Comair also notes “The root cause of this accident is under investigation by the SACAA [South African Civil Aviation Authority], which has also requested the support of the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States of America… The final report and  findings are expected to be received later this year. Following the event and as a precaution, all maintenance events and records were reviewed with no discrepancies noted.” The plane was inspected by a Boeing evaluation team and it was declared to be “beyond economical repair”. Comair wrote off a value of R64.5 million related to this aircraft and received R84.5 million in compensation, both of which are charged through the income statement. Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
