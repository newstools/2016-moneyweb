PRETORIA If economic growth remains below 2% for an extended period, government may not be able to sustain its current policy commitments, National Treasury has warned.While there are clear benefits to proposals to increase spending on health, education, defence, social development and infrastructure, South Africa would not be able to afford all these programmes while also managing the country s finances in a prudent way, it said. The limited space available to increase taxation cannot accommodate all of these aims. Even in the most optimistic growth scenario, a phased approach to implementation based on a clear choice of priorities is required. Difficult trade-offs are needed to resume the expansion of public resources available for social and economic development. For now, however, long-term policy aspirations far exceed available resources. Government has revised its GDP growth forecast for 2016 from 0.9% in February to 0.5% in its Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate over the next three years, with economic growth projected to reach 2.2% in 2019.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan did not refer to specific programmes that would have to be reprioritised during a press conference on Wednesday, but said South Africa may have to build eight instead of 10 of something .Amidst pressure to reduce the budget deficit and against a background of muted economic growth, some commentators have warned that South Africa does not have the money for a planned nuclear programme, while others suggested that additional tax measures would have to be implemented in order to fund the National Health Insurance (NHI).Gordhan said provinces have carried a heavy burden over the past few years and have done remarkable work to curtail the extent of recruitment, yet the government wage bill will likely remain under scrutiny. Medium-term projections show that to stay within budgets over the next three years, all national departments will have to moderate headcounts.This will be achieved through attrition, as staff who retire or leave employment will not be replaced, the MTBPS indicated.The public sector wage bill is one of government s biggest expenditure items.Other trade-offs include balancing consumption and investment decisions.The MTBPS proposed a R26 billion reduction to the expenditure ceiling over the next two years.Without detailing specific plans in this regard, proposed tax measures are expected to raise R13 billion in the 2017/18 fiscal year. Combined with higher taxes signaled in the February budget, total revenue increases amount to R43 billion over the next two years.Net national debt is expected to stabilise at 47.9% of GDP in 2019/20.
