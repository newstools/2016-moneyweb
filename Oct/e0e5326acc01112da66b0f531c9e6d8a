NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Luthuli Capital was founded and structured as a Pan-African multi specialist company that offers a global approach to wealth management portfolios. The company offers investment advisory services to local and foreign individuals and multinationals, among others. I&#8217;m joined in the studio by one of the co-founders, Mduduzi Luthuli. Thank you so much for your time.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: Thank you for the invitation. Glad to be here.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Let&#8217;s take it back to the beginning and start off with how Luthuli Capital came together.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: I think if you are going to start a company it&#8217;s always something that s there. It&#8217;s just a matter of acquiring the skills for you to be confident to run the company and wait for the circumstances to be there.I&#8217;ve been in the corporate sector now from banking into the financial advisory industry for about seven years. My previous employer gave me a great opportunity in management and it&#8217;s really there where I got to cut my teeth and get to the point where I realised I think it&#8217;s time for me to go out there and do this on my own.We&#8217;ve got two offices here in Sandton and one in Durban. It really was the Durban office that was also the big motivator because we&#8217;ve got a project going on down there which involves the internship, and that also just got to that point where, if ever you are going to do this, this is the time.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: And I know that you work with Trudy as well. How did the two of you decide that it&#8217;s our synergies and both our characteristics and everything we&#8217;ve learned from our own sort of corporate size that can work together and let&#8217;s do this?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: We both come from the same industry. So from a product knowledge side, services, the competency was there. I think really where the synergy comes from is they say I&#8217;m the driving force, I&#8217;m the bully, I&#8217;m the hard-core one. My real talent is bringing the clients into the business, going out there and selling the dream and convincing them that this is something you should back.And Trudy, as head of client services, is the mother of the business, if I can put it that way. And really her strength is in client retention. You play a fine balance between finding new clients and also looking after your existing clients. And that s really where we work with each other s strengths and work very well together, because she heads up the client retention. I bring them and she looks after them.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: How competitive is the industry that you are in right now?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: It&#8217;s extremely competitive. I don t think I have the words to truly describe how competitive an industry it is. One of the fantastic things and one of the shining lights about South Africa is that we have a very good financial system. Or let me say that the governance and the legislation here is very good and that really translates into the financial advisory system with the initiatives that the FSB puts out there the financial planning institution, to make sure that as financial advisors or wealth managers we move away from a culture of just selling for the sake of selling, and seeing ourselves and conducting ourselves as professionals and as a professional field.So now you are working in an industry where you have exceptional professionals, people giving advice. And really you have to convince the client as to say why you. And I would even say you have very established players, your Allan Gray, your Stanlibs of the world, your Old Mutual, your Liberty. So as a new company going after clients and acquiring big clients, there s already someone existing there, giving them advice; there is really an existing relationship. Now you have to convince them to say: what am I bringing to the party that will convince them? It&#8217;s very competitive.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Before we get to the internship programme and we were talking about the financial industry there is a lot of talk. You have Absa talking about it, you get a lot of industry professionals talking about transformation in the financial services industry. Some argue it from the point of we need more women to come on board and be fund managers, portfolio managers, etc. Others say we are all competing for the same pie, a little bit more, etc. What are your thoughts on transformation in the financial industry?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: It&#8217;s definitely something that needs to be looked at. I would challenge anyone to go to any investment seminar, whether it&#8217;s held by the FSB, the Financial Planning Institute or the big players, and the reality is the room will be dominated by white Afrikaans males over the age of 45.The nice thing about going into our business is that it also allows you to do proper succession planning, estate planning. And all that means is if I start my company and I run it well, I now have the opportunity to pass it on to my children to say, listen, I&#8217;ve started Luthuli Capital, it&#8217;s been going for 30 years. Don t go and study law or art or whatever. Take over the company. So you have these established players and they are now bringing in the second, third generation.The reality of the country is we might have political freedom, but we certainly don t have economic freedom. If you look at the mass population, where is the money still sitting? So it&#8217;s a matter of me not just coming in and saying look, I&#8217;m competent, I know how to do this, but it&#8217;s how do you then infiltrate this private club. Or the other way to look at it is how we get money to flow out of a few hands to the mass population and thus that gives me a new market to work with.So transformation is definitely still needed. But my view on it is just you can sit around and complain or you can start actively playing a role in the industry and start giving people an alternative because, as a black wealth manager, my job is No 1, not just to prove to you that I&#8217;m competent, but it&#8217;s to prove that I&#8217;m even more competent than my white counterpart.And that s the reality more so with our black clients, unfortunately. You have to convince them even more than our white clients that listen, we can do this and we can do an exceptional job. So it&#8217;s still a long road but it&#8217;s a road we are going to have to walk. There s no short cut.And my role in that is in running Luthuli Capital. It&#8217;s just to do a fantastic job because if I do a poor job then the next black person who wants to start a wealth-management business I&#8217;ve just made their job harder because that s the legacy I&#8217;ve left.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: So you have this internship programme that you ve started. Tell us about what inspired it.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: I think one of the biggest problems that we have in this country is access to education. We all know what&#8217;s happening in our universities with the #FeesMustFall movement. But even more I think what we tend to miss is not the access just to formal education in terms of getting a degree, but it&#8217;s also the access to soft skills.I know some very, very smart people whom I&#8217;ve worked with in corporate, but I saw very early on that they were not progressing in their careers. I even overtook them, even though they were smarter than me, simply because they didn t know the softer skills. I&#8217;m talking about things like how do you answer a phone, how do you write an email, how do you dress appropriately for work, how do you carry yourself in a corporate environment? That s the side we really, really miss.I think one of the biggest contributors to our unemployment in South Africa is not just the lack of economic growth, hence we are not creating jobs, but the mere fact that even if we create those jobs we have such a big population that is unemployable if I can use that term.In creating the internship that s really my drive. What I&#8217;m hoping for is, yes, we want to find the best of the best because we are in the service industry. And if I hire you to my company you need to be competent. You are working with people s money. But I said rather let me face the challenge or let me try and find the unemployable and see if I can make them employable.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: So what are the criteria and the selection process you use?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: The criteria are literally that you just need to have passed matric and higher grade mathematics, and then if you ve done accounting or business studies that s an extra. I&#8217;ve purposely done that because when you say your criterion is you are looking for graduates, you once again are missing the mass market. Some can say look, you are going about it the hard way. But you have to. That s the thing. It goes back to the question you asked about transformation. There is no short cut. Someone has to take the long road.So for me it&#8217;s literally that when we met we started off with 41 and we haven t been going for long. Already that s dwindled down to about 32 people.When if first met with the group I said I&#8217;m not looking for work history, I&#8217;m not looking for skill. All I&#8217;m looking for is the right attitude. You can&#8217;t teach attitude. If someone is lazy, I&#8217;m sorry, they are lazy. What I said to them is I can teach you the formal skills. You can do a certificate course and from there you graduate to doing a financial planning diploma, and from there you do you CFP, which is the post-grad diploma. That side we can teach you, even the softer skills I talked about, to say let&#8217;s take you on I don t know what the right word is for it like a business course. How do you connect stuff in business? That I can teach you.All I&#8217;m looking for is for you to show me that you are someone with the right attitude for me to commit my time and my money and it&#8217;s not cheap. And hopefully at the end of this, out of the 40 I even said to them, if I get five people out of this I ll be happy. If more, fantastic.Ja, that s what we are really trying to do to say can this be done, can you really take someone who has nothing but the right attitude and get them to be an exceptional wealth manager? For me it&#8217;s also in building the business. You understand that as the business owner you set the culture. So that s what the internship allows me to do to say who is Luthuli Capital? What is our culture?NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Okay. So it rolled out in Durban first, this 30-something&#8230;MDUDUZI LUTHULI: Yes, it&#8217;s rolled out in Durban and we are currently looking to see how we can also introduce it here in Joburg. The reason why we started in Durban is we&#8217;ve got a project there with a service provider. Their head offices are in Durban and this was also a partnership with them to say we all start businesses because we want to be business moguls, listed one day and be successful. Everyone wants success. But part of the success has to be what change, what influence did I bring? What&#8217;s my legacy?So I partnered with our business partner as their service provider to say in doing this is there space for us to start the internship programme and to say I&#8217;ve got these people. Right now they are just working as referral agents, meaning that they go out looking for clients and they bring them in because they are not in a position to be giving advice. And for the next six months we are doing an internal course with them inside the business. And all that internal course is to give them the basics of the industry, the introduction, the building blocks, and then for me to say who in this group is showing the capability to take it to the next step. That&#8217;s where we are.So it&#8217;s an internal programme for six months; thereafter they go and write their RFI exams, their regulation exams, so they can be in a position to start giving advice. And while doing that they will also be doing the wealth management certificate. It&#8217;s a 12- to 18-month course. And those that pass from there are qualified to move to the next step, which is to do the diploma. So all in all it&#8217;s about a three-year programme.I&#8217;ve said to them I&#8217;m looking for the best. Not all of you will make it, but those of you who don t make it to the next step, at least you ve got employment. I&#8217;m already paying you for a basic-level job, if I can put it like that, and then you decide how far you want to take it.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: And this exam that they write, the regulation exam that you mentioned and the next one is this an exam that s funded by you, or you and the service provider as a partnership?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: It&#8217;s 100% funded by Luthuli Capital, which is why I said this is not something we are taking lightly. It is a very costly task. That&#8217;s what I said to them just convince me that it&#8217;s not money wasted. The money is there, it&#8217;s just for you to convince me to spend this money instead of buying another car or something like that, or using the money to expand our office, or buy a new printer. Rather, this is money that should be ploughed into human capital.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: So once it&#8217;s a success in Durban, and you ve got your five or whoever you are going to incorporate into Luthuli Capital, is there scope for you to bring it into Johannesburg and then see what kind of skills are out here?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: It&#8217;s definitely something we want to bring to the Joburg office long before the Durban one is a success or not a success. Those guys I&#8217;ve said to them that my dream is that you will be my future team, the future leaders of the Durban office. I currently split my time between both offices. I spend a week here, I spend a week there and so on. That s unsustainable. Already I&#8217;m exhausted and we&#8217;ve just started.That s what I&#8217;m trying to do to one day know that I&#8217;ve got an office in Durban that requires very little intervention from me. But obviously to build something like that requires a lot of your time initially. That&#8217;s what we want to do here because the Joburg office really has a lot of my clientele. I&#8217;ve been in Joburg for over ten years.So it&#8217;s very established here in terms of having an existing team, although what we don t have now is who s the next generation. So it&#8217;s a matter of staying with the Joburg office do I just say actually I am going to go and look out for someone already qualified to build into the already strong team, or do we want to have the same outlook to say, actually let&#8217;s build our own people?NASTASSIA ARENDSE: What next for Luthuli Capital in the next medium to long-term what should we be looking out for?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: Pshew. There is quite a lot. That s a tricky question because you put things out there that sometimes are not fully dependent on you.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Let&#8217;s put it this way. What do you hope to achieve in the next year or two when you and I sit down again and we are catching up?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: The business is still very new, so really right now the biggest thing is about building the brand. But I ll also say on top of that it&#8217;s building a certain type of brand. One of the arguments we have a lot in the office is we want to be a quality band.So does that mean we are building a business that only caters to high net worth individuals is that what we are trying to do? Or are we building a brand that s going to empower the mass population, because financial planning or financial management skills are still very much non-existent in our population?I&#8217;ve got an array of clients from CEOs to your normal middle class, call them black diamonds, and you d think especially with the high end, when you sit with people like that, do you think what value am I going to bring? Surely this person has the estate planning or financial planning really, really planned out. And you find that that s really not the case. So there is still a need. As much as the industry is competitive, there is still a lot to be done. So for me it&#8217;s about getting the brand out there so people don t say who is Luthuli Capital.But then also really the internal dilemma is who do we want Luthuli Capital to be? We have a lot of projects that we are working on but I d be sort of reluctant to put them out there.Hopefully when we sit in two years time I can then say ask me this question and this is what we&#8217;ve done. That s really the short of it to get the brand out there and not just to exist for the sake of existing but to start having an impact.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: So far, what is the most satisfying part for you about this entrepreneurial journey that you and Trudy have embarked on?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: I think for the first time I really understand and people say why a business that you end up seeing as your child, because it really will drive you crazy. You become bipolar. There are points in the business where you wake up and you wonder, what am I doing? Why am I doing this? I&#8217;ve a family to look after. Is this the right thing, have I taken too much risk? And you feel like giving up.And it&#8217;s at those points that God will just throw you a bone. I say, no, no, no, keep going. And you like okay, maybe this is the right thing to do. But I think for the first time in my life I&#8217;m truly motivated because I know that the success or failure of this business is dependent on me and my efforts and I&#8217;m creating something for myself.So I don t need to justify why am I working 15, 16 hours a day. It&#8217;s for me. But it is really, really difficult. And I can understand, No 1, why it&#8217;s not for everyone, why we don t all go out there and start businesses. I would always say one of the best things I did was not to go straight from varsity into opening the business, even though it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking about since back in the day. It&#8217;s important to start in the corporate world and get to know your industry, and know who your friends and foes are, and how things work. It&#8217;s meaningful. Even everything from just buying paper for the printer.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: The simple things.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: Simple things. It&#8217;s meaningful. You know why you are doing it.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Well, I wish you the best with Luthuli Capital and of course your internship programme. I do hope to see it rolled out in Johannesburg and see what happens there. Thank you so much for your time.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: Thank you for inviting me, and I would ask people just to go to social media on the Facebook page, which is Luthuli Capital. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn, Mduduzi we also have a Luthuli Capital page. And for anyone interested in the internship programme and who would want to know developments, that s where we will be putting them out. And obviously on our website, LuthuliCapital.com.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: No Twitter? Not yet?MDUDUZI LUTHULI: People laugh at me because I don t know whether to be ashamed of this, but I&#8217;ve never been on Twitter. I&#8217;ve no idea how it works. We have a Twitter page, but I would be even scared to tell people to go to our Twitter page because I think there s one post there. So I think I need to have a younger partner in the business who can start saying, listen, you old people, get on Twitter. It&#8217;s the future. Twitter and Instagram those are the examples. We&#8217;ll get there.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Baby steps.MDUDUZI LUTHULI: But we do have a Twitter page. It&#8217;s @LuthuliCapital, but we just need to get that going. It has as much information as our Facebook and LinkedIn.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: The only pressuring part about you mentioning that Twitter page is that when you leave this building now you are sort of obliged to keep it posted and going as current as you can make it.But that was Mduduzi Luthuli, one of the co-founders of Luthuli Capital.
