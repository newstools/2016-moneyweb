It s becoming increasingly difficult to pick gems in SA s more than R350 billion listed property sector in recent months given the volatility in global markets and domestically, the pesky rand.Over the past ten years, listed property has been consistent in delivering above-inflation returns and outperformed equities (the JSE s all share index) and even bonds (ten-year government bond).But all market darlings fall from glory, and the South African Listed Property Index (Sapy), which includes the JSE s largest 20 real estate companies, seems to be the latest to do so.The Sapy index has delivered total returns of 9.9% (at the time of writing) in the year to October 25, figures from Stanlib show. However, bonds are proving to be a far better bet for income-chasing investors than listed property, delivering total returns of 15.1% while equities are the laggard with total returns of 4.5%.Higher bond yields, which have risen to nearly 9% in a matter of weeks, is one of the reasons behind the swing in listed property, as the asset class is sensitive to bond yields movements. You don t have to look far for reasons behind the ructions in the bond market: political uncertainty that has heightened the likelihood of a downgrade to SA s sovereign credit rating in December and the possibility that US interest rates might rise.Grindrod Asset Management s chief investment officer Ian Anderson says an obvious reason impacting the property index has been the strength of the rand.The strength of the local unit (by 11% so far this year) is bad news for offshore property companies as they are more sensitive to rand movements than their SA-focused peers. Anderson says about 40% of the index is exposed to offshore markets, largely in Central and Eastern Europe. Ten years ago, the sector had no exposure to international markets.Industry players expect that three more offshore companies mainly Germany-focused Sirius Real Estate, Europe-focused Greenbay Properties and Poland play Echo Polska Properties to be included into the Sapy index at the expense of Christo Wiese s Tradehold, Octodec Investments and Accelerate Property Fund that might be bumped off the index in December (See composition of Sapy Index below).FTSE/JSE SA Listed Property (SAPY)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CompanyJurisdiction Index Weight (%)Market cap (R Billion)Growthpoint PropertiesSouth Africa-focused19.1672.6Redefine PropertiesSouth Africa-focused14.7358.0New Europe Property InvestmentOffshore-focused10.9053.3Resilient REITSouth Africa- focused8.7642.2Hyprop InvestmentsSouth Africa-focused8.3529.8Fortress Income Fund BSouth Africa- focused6.3632.5Fortress Income Fund ASouth Africa- focused5.018.4Rockcastle Global Real Estate CoOffshore-focused4.7134.9SA Corporate Real Estate FundSouth Africa-focused3.5313.4Vukile Property FundSouth Africa-focused3.3412.8Attacq LimitedSouth Africa-focused2.9412.9Arrowhead PropertiesSouth Africa-focused2.298.8Investec Property FundSouth Africa-focused1.796.4Emira Property FundSouth Africa-focused1.737.1Rebosis Property FundSouth Africa-focused1.366.1MAS Real EstateOffshore-focused1.198.2Pivotal FundSouth Africa-focused1.065.5Accelerate Property FundSouth Africa-focused1.045.5Octodec InvestmentsSouth Africa-focused0.955.5Stenprop LtdOffshore-focused0.415.6TradeholdOffshore-focused0.414.1Some SA-focused companies are also invested in offshore markets.Source: Grindrod Asset Management and Moneyweb.Offshore counters hammeredAlthough offshore property counters were the among best performers last year, their sparkle has since dimmed. In fact, there is a big variance in the total returns posted by individual offshore stocks, which have been the losers and local property stocks that have claimed the top spot.For example, commercial and residential property company SA Corporate Real Estate Fund and the owner of hotel properties Hospitality-B have emerged as the top winners, delivering total returns of 32% and 31% respectively in the year to October 25 (See graph below).Listed property&nbsp;&nbsp;Top winners &#8211; year to date (October 25)&nbsp;CompanyJurisdictionTotal returns (%)Hospitality-BSouth Africa-focused31SA Corporate Real Estate FundSouth Africa-focused32Hyprop InvestmentsSouth Africa-focused24Rebosis Property FundSouth Africa-focused22Redefine PropertiesSouth Africa-focused18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top losers &#8211; year to date (October 25)&nbsp;Capital &amp; Counties PropertiesOffshore-focused-52Capital and RegionalOffshore-focused-33Redefine InternationalOffshore-focused-33Atlantic LeafOffshore-focused-32Intu PropertiesOffshore-focused-32Source: MoneywebUK-focused Capital &amp; Counties Properties (Capco) total returns have slid by 52%, cementing it as a top loser. Capco a long favoured rand-hedge property stock by punters has emerged as a casualty from the UK s glum economic prospects following the Brexit vote, with jittery investors aggressively selling down the company s stock since June.Even some local counters are feeling the pinch with some of the losers including, Freedom Property Fund (-46%), Balwin Properties (-17%), Attacq Limited (-6.8%) and Acsion Limited (-5.58%). Catalyst Fund Managers portfolio manager Zayd Sulaiman says the showing by these companies is linked to poor fundamentals in the SA s property sector. There is an oversupply of office space. Consumers are under pressure and the retail sector is also coming under pressure with a lot of retail schemes brought on stream recently. It is difficult to develop in SA as the demand for properties and space from tenants is declining, he says.Stock picksThe big question is where market watchers are finding value in the sector. For Liliane Barnard, the CEO Metope Investment Managers, it s all about company fundamentals. We look to identify companies that have good assets and clear strategies for long-term growth: who can deliver income and capital growth throughout the cycle and not just taking advantage of currently low funding rates offshore, which comes at the expense of growth in income. As far as hitching your wagons in markets beyond SA, she says investors need to assess offshore property companies on a case-by-case basis. Going offshore, after all, brings a different set of risks such as currency fluctuations, which can impact rand-based earrings, and exposure to unfamiliar economies. South African managers that invest offshore need to show a thorough understanding and/or a competitive advantage in these markets in order to justify their investments in these jurisdictions, Barnard tells MoneywebGrindrod Asset Management still finds value in SA-focused listed property companies, which are trading at discounts to net asset value (NAV) and very attractive initial income yields, says Anderson. While some of these companies have also started venturing offshore, their smaller size and limited liquidity has meant that they have attracted little or no institutional support and therefore they still offer exceptional value, he says.The head of property at MMI Investments &amp; Savings Nesi Chetty favours Hyprop Investments, the owner of shopping malls including Johannesburg-based Hyde Park Corner, Rosebank Mall, Canal Walk Shopping Centre in Cape Town, and others.It has delivered total returns of 24% in the year to October 25.Chetty backs Hyprop due to its quality retail property portfolio and good re-valuations in their portfolio. He adds that large shares such as Hyprop are owned by a number of foreign investors and are the first to feel the pain when investors are jittery about SA.Chetty also finds value in mid-cap Emira Property Fund, Germany-focused Sirius Real Estate and last year s top performing stock Fortress B given their growing and transforming property portfolios.
