The Presidency has hit back at the “relentless public attacks” on President Jacob Zuma by Sipho Pityana, chairman of AngloGold Ashanti, and Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye Gold, and said business should communicate their concerns with the president through other “avenues”. In a statement, the Presidency states that it respects the rights of citizens and leaders to freedom of speech, but that the business sector has many avenues to raise whatever concerns and issues it has with government and/or its leadership. “President Zuma values open dialogue and interaction with all sectors in our society. However, such dialogue is more helpful if it takes place within the bounds of human decency and decorum and upholds respect for key institutions and in our country.” On Wednesday Pityana reiterated his call for Zuma to step down, during an address at The Joburg Indaba. He accused Zuma of being the sponsor-in-chief of corruption: “Leaders found guilty of corruption or misrepresentation no longer fall on their swords for the greater good. These days they remain in office, inured to the shame of public opprobrium and cheered on by their superiors. And why not, when we have a President who literally laughs off any suggestion that government be held to a higher standard — and is, in fact, the sponsor-in-chief of corruption?” Last month Froneman also called for Zuma to step down during a visit to Denver in the US. Pityana and Froneman’s public criticism of Zuma also follows an appeal from Zuma last month at an event of the Presidential CEO Initiative that the public should “refrain from making public utterances that promote a negative narrative about the country which undermine our collective drive to reignite economic growth and jeopardise job creation.”
