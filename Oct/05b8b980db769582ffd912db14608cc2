Deutsche Bank AG’s negotiations with the US Justice Department to resolve a years-long investigation into the lender’s handling of mortgage-backed securities are continuing, according to people familiar with the matter. Germany’s Bild newspaper reported in its Sunday edition that CEO John Cryan wasn’t able to reach an agreement with the Justice Department during a meeting in Washington. He was there to help negotiate potential multi-billion-dollar penalties, according to the report. The German lender and US authorities haven’t broken off their talks, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. © 2016 Bloomberg L.P
