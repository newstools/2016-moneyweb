Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, the Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma seem to be heading for a collision at the High Court, after Madonsela made it clear in a televised interview with News24 on Tuesday night that she will publish a report on so-called &#8216;State capture&#8217; before her term expires on Friday.This comes despite a letter from Zuma asking for an undertaking from her to allow him to question those witnesses who implicated him, and to refrain from publishing any report .The investigation focuses on alleged unethical and improper conduct by Zuma and State officials relating to their alleged inappropriate relations with the Gupta family.Madonsela on News24 said it includes allegations by deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas that the Guptas offered him the job as finance minister. This was before Zuma fired former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene in December last year, leading to the eventual appointment of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Also included in the report is an allegation by ANC stalwart Vytjie Mentor that the family offered her a Cabinet post; as well as request by a complainant that she investigates why Cabinet got involved in a dispute between the Guptas and the banks that closed their accounts.Madonsela said on Tuesday night that she would publish the first report in a two-phased approach that will tell the story that we know and indicate what still needs to be done and who has to do it.Attorney for the Gupta family Gert van der Merwe, said on SABC radio station RSG on Wednesday morning that if Madonsela proceeds to publish the report without listening to the evidence they want to present to her, he will advise them to take it on review in the High Court.This follows a letter he sent her on Tuesday afternoon on behalf of his clients, accusing her of being biased. He said in the letter that she was not following due process, as she brushed aside his request to address her witnesses on behalf of his clients and failed to provide the questions she wanted Ajay Gupta to answer, timeously.Van der Merwe warned Madonsela that in his opinion her conduct, if she publishes the report on Friday without addressing his concerns, would amount to bad faith, which means she could be held personally liable for any damage the Guptas might suffer as a result of adverse findings against them.Constitutional law expert Marinus Wiechers told Moneyweb that a review application based on the concerns Van der Merwe raised in his letter to Madonsela, would be based on sound arguments, provided it can be proven.He says the letters Zuma and the Guptas sent to Madonsela are very well drafted, most probably with input from the best senior advocates and are clearly coordinated, which is not unusual in such cases .He says such a review procedure would, however, not make the issue go away. In fact, the court procedure is open and would be highly publicised. This is just the beginning&#8230; he says.The question, he says, is how her successor Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane will deal with the matter, especially since she has already said it won t be prioritised.Wiechers says by publishing the report, which would result in a court review, Madonsela is, in fact, forcing Mkhwebane to make the matter a priority.While Madonsela won t be in office anymore, the investigation is being done by a whole team of investigators who would be available to advise Mkhwebane and support the defence of the review application by the office.
