PRETORIA – The end of South Africa’s interest rate hiking cycle may be in sight if inflation conditions remain consistent with latest forecasts, but the bar for loosening policy is high, the central bank said on Monday. In its second and final monetary policy review for 2016, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said risks to the inflation forecasts were more evenly balanced since the previous review in April. The bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 7% last month, with a weak economic growth outlook balancing out concerns about the inflation trajectory. On Monday it said the risks to the inflation outlook remained considerable, but it was now clearer than earlier in the year that the risks went both ways. “Should conditions develop in line with the current forecasts, it may at some point become possible to conclude the policy tightening cycle,” it said in the review. “However, the bar for loosening policy is high, requiring a substantial, sustained improvement in forecast inflation bringing it more comfortably within the 3-6% range,” it added, reiterating comments made at last month’s policy meeting.
