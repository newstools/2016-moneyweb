There was no political interference in the decision to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, former acting commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) Ivan Pillay and former commissioner Oupa Magashula, said Shaun Abrahams, head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), during a press briefing on Tuesday. He said the decision to prosecute the three was made by the Special Director of Public Prosecutions in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions. “I can assure you that there is no political interference in this matter; there has been no political interference in the decision-making process.” The press conference followed news that Gordhan, Pillay and Magashula were served with summonses on Tuesday morning and will appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2. Prior to Abrahams’ press conference, Gordhan addressed a Gauteng Province Open Tender 16 seminar in Midrand:   He said from the stage: “This is a moment when South Africans should really ask themselves who are these few people in the Hawks really serving? Where do they get their political instructions from…and for what purpose?” He also said that: “We have just come back from telling all sorts of people we are fine in this country. Our message to all sorts of investors who assess our economic and fiscal performance. We said, give us a year and we will show you that South Africa can adapt and get results and this will not require that somebody put us in the so-called ‘junk’ territory.” Gordhan said the timing of the issuing of the summons is strange as it is 15 days before the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). The rand reacted swiftly, depreciating by more than 3.52% after the news became public, hitting a low of R14.2913 against the US dollar. At 23:45 the rand had dropped further to trade at R14.3749 against the dollar. The currency also lost 2.09% against the pound at R17.437 and 3.42% against the euro at R15.88. The JSE has proven resilient and closed 0.43% higher at 51 899 points. The banking industry was hardest hit, with the banking index down 3.58%. All the banks were in the red with Nedbank (-4.4%) and Standard Bank (-3.6%) hardest hit. The resource index was up 1.84%. MTBPS The announcement of the charges comes at a crucial time for South Africa. Gordhan is set to present a critical MTBPS on October 26. This MTBPS will set out South Africa’s fiscal roadmap for the next three years and will be an important source of information for rating agencies when they review South Africa’s credit rating in November and December. Abrahams said that the charges do not relate to the so-called “rogue unit” that resided within Sars, as the investigation into potential criminal activity in the setting up and the operations of the unit, although being at an advanced stage, were still ongoing. The actual charges relate to the alleged contravention of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA) with the approval of Pillay’s early retirement, Sars’s decision to fund his pension shortfall, and his reappointment in an acting capacity. Abrahams also reacted defiantly during the question-and-answer session that followed his presentation. In reaction to a question regarding the timing of the announcement, he posed a question in turn to the journalist: “I want to pose the following question to you, and every like-minded person like you: What if this decision was made by a judge? What if this decision was taken by the Public Protector? Would your reaction have been the same? The days of disrespecting the decisions of the NPA are over. The days of looking at the NPA in such a light, are over. The days of non-accountability and not holding senior government officials accountable, are over.” Gordhan excluded from ministerial task team In another interesting development, President Jacob Zuma has omitted Gordhan from a special ministerial task team to address the violence on campuses around the country. Zuma announced the task team on Monday night, prior to the serving of the summonses. The task team includes no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers, but not Gordhan or his deputy. The seven ministers are:
• Jeff Radebe, minister in the presidency for planning, monitoring and evaluation (convener);
• Blade Nzimande, minister of higher education and training;
• Naledi Pandor, minister of science and technology
• Michael Masutha, minister of justice and correctional services
• Nathi Nhleko, minister of police
• David Mahlobo minister of state security
• Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, minister of defence and military veterans 
• Malusi Gigaba minister of home affairs.
