PRETORIA If South Africa sticks to its path of fiscal consolidation and properly executes plans to ignite economic growth it will satisfy ratings agencies.This was Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s clear message at a press conference ahead of his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) on Wednesday.National Treasury revised its economic growth forecast for South Africa from 0.9% in February to 0.5%, but noted that green shoots were emerging as additional sources of electricity supply came on stream, drought conditions improve and exports recover on the back of a weaker currency. Working days lost as a result of strikes have also fallen.S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch both affirmed South Africa s credit rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating in June. S&amp;P kept its negative outlook, while Fitch retained a stable outlook. Moody s also affirmed its Baa2 rating (two notches above sub-investment grade) with a negative outlook early in May.Ratings agencies are due to announce their latest review decisions in the next few weeks. While bond markets seemed to have priced in a downgrade to junk status already, and some commentators believe the probability of such an event may be as high as 80%, Gordhan stressed that South Africa was not in a hopeless situation , with real GDP growth expected to accelerate to 1.3% in 2017 and 2% in 2018.In its June review, S&amp;P highlighted four key structural measures necessary for South Africa to put the economy on firmer footing and maintain its investment grade status. These included the provision of a reliable source of energy, labour reform, the mining code and the cohesion of the executive branch.Gordhan said the implementation of structural reforms was happening at varying paces. This includes progress with the Minerals and Petroleum Development Bill and labour market reforms. The MTBPS highlighted that additional sources of electricity supply were being connected to the grid.Gordhan did not want to be drawn on his fraud charges and court appearance on November 2 and said these issues would be addressed next week.The minister stressed that monetary and fiscal policy measures were not enough to place the South African economy on a firmer footing, but that a co-ordinated effort between government, business and labour was necessary to ensure inclusive growth.Deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas stressed the importance of investor confidence to boost the economy and warned that any sign of political noise was likely to have a negative impact on growth.He said a collective effort was necessary to foster a better political climate or South Africa ran the risk of reversing the gains it has made.
