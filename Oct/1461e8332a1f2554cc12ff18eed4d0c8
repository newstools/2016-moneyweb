First National Bank customers on Tuesday morning complained that they couldn’t access the company’s online banking facilities, or its transactional banking application. The glitches also affected the bank’s share trading website, FNB Securities, point-of-sale terminals and ATMs. Chief information officer Mo Hassem confirmed the outage, saying a connectivity issue is impacting access to services. “The bank apologises to impacted customers for the inconvenience caused. We wish to assure our customers that we are working hard to resolve the matter and restore services,” Hassem said in a statement. “We will continue to provide updates.” Update: FNB said at 11am that functionality has been restored to ATMs and point-of-sale terminals, with limited functionality currently on online banking. “Our technicians continue to work hard to restore connectivity across all channels,” said Hassem.  — (c) 2016 NewsCentral Media This article was first published on TechCentral.
