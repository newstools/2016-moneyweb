JOHANNESBURG – The South African central bank governor said on Tuesday the decline in consumer inflation to within the bank’s target range of 3-6% is expected to be temporary and that there is no room for complacency in monetary policy. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 7% for a third consecutive time this year last month, with a weak economic growth outlook balancing out concerns about inflation. “We have, however, benefited in recent months from movements in from some global and domestic factors that have aided downward revisions to our inflation forecast,” Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago said in a speech delivered in New York and posted on the bank’s website. “We also know that the positive factors underlying the more favourable outlook can change very quickly, and therefore there is no room for complacency.” South African inflation stood at 5.9% in August. Kganyago also said the central bank’s focus was on the impact of the rand exchange rate on the inflation outlook. He added that the bank remained committed to a flexible exchange rate, but in the event of abrupt movements in the currency that could threaten the orderly functioning of markets the bank would “consider becoming involved by way of facilitating the smooth execution of trades.” Domestic political upheavals and uncertainty over the timing of interest rates hike in the United States has seen the rand volatile lately, with the currency weakening nearly 2% against the dollar on Tuesday.
