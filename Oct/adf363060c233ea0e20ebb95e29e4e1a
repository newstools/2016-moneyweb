The current CEO of multinational mobile telecommunications company MTN, Mteto Nyati, has a career timeline that looks like a finely-tuned, perfectly-implemented strategy for professional success. Yet Nyati maintains that his greatest strength is his ‘expertise’ in failing. In fact, he goes on to say that the accomplished individual we see when we look at the Mteto Nyati of today, is really the sum of a number of earlier failures. Exactly how has his attitude to failure propelled him into the leadership of a company that, in October 2015, emerged as the Most Admired and the Most Valuable African brand, valued at US$4,672 million? In this 2’41” extract from a full-length, in-depth video interview, Nyati speaks frankly about his business leadership lessons and his approach to continuous course correction. Keep an eye out for the full-length interview, due to be published here, next Wednesday, October 12 2016.
