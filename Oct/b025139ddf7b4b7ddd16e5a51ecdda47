Gold held near a three-month low as investors awaited Friday s U.S. jobs report for more clues on when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates amid growing expectation for a hike soon.Gold was little changed at $1,267.80 an ounce by 11:59 a.m. in London. It has been rattled this week by rising bond yields and concern that policy makers are starting to question whether monetary easing will be enough to revive the global economy. Ultra-low rates are not necessarily here to stay, Fed Vice-Chairman Stanley Fischer said Wednesday.Higher borrowing costs curb the appeal of holding gold because it doesn t return any yield. Traders see a 62 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates by year-end, up from 51 percent at the start of last week. If the U.S. employment report is better than expected, the risk of a break below $1,259 is high, Georgette Boele, a currency and commodity strategist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, said by e-mail, referring to gold s 200-day average.
