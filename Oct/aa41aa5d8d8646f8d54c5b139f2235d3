JOHANNESBURG The 2016 tax bills, which give effect to the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP) that commenced on October 1, were tabled in Parliament alongside the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement on Wednesday.The SVDP provides individuals and companies with a nine-month window to regularise undisclosed or unauthorised foreign assets and associated income in anticipation of the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities.Andrew Knight, partner at global advisory and administration firm Maitland, says South Africa is not the only country that recently introduced a regularisation programme.In fact, when the driving force behind the programme, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), started to formulate the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) rules, it encouraged countries to introduce regularisation programmes to give taxpayers the opportunity to become compliant. The CRS is a set of global standards that govern how tax authorities in participating countries share information about the financial assets of their taxpayers.But does regularising your affairs through the SVDP or normal VDP process automatically mean that you don t have to worry about the CRS or disclosures anymore?Knight says in cases of fairly simple structures for example where travellers cheques have been kept offshore but were never disclosed there will likely be no complexities once it has been regularised through a voluntary disclosure programme, but particularly for high net worth individuals, whose structures are often quite complex, the CRS may give rise to reporting that goes beyond what was disclosed during regularisation.He says although individual taxpayers may feel comfortable that regularising their affairs in this way shouldn t give rise to any additional tax liability (depending on the complexity of the structures) it is important to understand the implications of the CRS as far as information flow and privacy is concerned.More than a 100 countries have signed up to the CRS and will start receiving information from all of the other countries about its taxpayers. It is all about tax compliance. It is all about getting information that is relevant to the tax affairs of the country s tax residents. Banks, investment funds and in many cases trustees will be sending information to the South African Revenue Service (Sars) by the middle of next year, but this will happen incrementally.Any individual who had an investment of over a $1 million on February 29 2016 will come to Sars s attention in the middle of next year. Any new accounts opened during the course of 2016, regardless of the size of the account (it may be as little as $10), will also be disclosed to Sars by the middle of 2017. Other accounts that were in place on February 29, regardless of whether they were held by an individual, company or another entity, won t be disclosed until a year later.Privacy concernsKnight argues that data about international financial transactions is as deserving of privacy as data flowing between mobile phones.However, financial information does have tax consequences and it is therefore legitimate to set up a system through which information that is relevant for tax purposes should find its way to the right place, so that the necessary taxation can happen, although this may come at a cost. The question really is whether the rules that give rise to this requirement to disclose actually go beyond what is relevant for purely tax purposes, he says.Another potential concern is whether the private information will be secure once it reaches a particular tax authority. If that government doesn t look after that information properly either makes it available to other people or simply is inefficient and allows the system to be hacked by one or other person or indeed uses it for other purposes, other political purposes then that is not what you want to achieve and that is when issues of privacy really do become important, Knight says.The basic rules of the CRS require that the information must be gathered and exchanged in a way that protects the integrity of the information. There are also rules about the format in which the information is exchanged and transmitted. In the South Africa context, the Tax Administration Act imposes certain confidentiality obligations associated with taxpayer information.Knight says the risk, however, is that the system gets hacked by an outsider or that there is somebody within the system who sees the opportunity to make some personal gain from it. So all the theory goes out the window if the actual operation of the system does not ensure the security of the information. Knight says in theory, taxpayers would have some redress in such events, but it is a difficult situation.He believes taxpayers are entitled to know what will be reported about them. The rules require a financial institution to let a taxpayer know that the information may get disclosed to Sars or another tax authority. There is a question as to how much detail you will get in terms of exactly what information will be provided, but you should certainly be notified that this disclosure process may impact on you.
