The greatest risk of going away on holiday is probably having a road accident or an emergency situation in an unfamiliar environment. With the festive season on the way, Dr Bobby Ramasia, principal officer of Bonitas Medical Fund, explains what medical aid members should know about their cover in case of emergencies.At the emergency sceneIf you are in an emergency medical situation, the medical personnel at the scene will assess your medical situation and ensure that you are as stabilised as best possible.Paramedics will then also try to determine whether you have medical aid and look for identification and medical aid stickers on your vehicle or for a medical aid card on your person.The ambulance will take you to the nearest, most suitable hospital if you are with a medical scheme this would probably be a private hospital with which your medical scheme has an agreement.How authorisation worksAll medical schemes require prior approval for payment for in-hospital treatment and procedures, even emergencies. Hence you should always apply for a pre-authorisation reference number (PAR) at your schemes&#8217; call centre as soon as a visit or admission to a hospital, a CT scan, an MRI scan, or radio-isotope study is required.However, getting pre-authorisation could be impossible if you are unconscious, for instance, and don t have your medical scheme membership details with you. If this happens or you are in any way unable to liaise with the call centre due to injury, this can be done by a family member or by the admission staff at the hospital. It is generally required that this is done within the first working day after the incident.Always try to have emergency contact numbers with you and carry your medical aid card so that pre-authorisation can be approved.Covered or not There are certain services and medical treatments which funds must fully cover, irrespective of the member s benefit plan, under Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs).An emergency medical condition is defined by the Medical Schemes Act as the sudden and, at the time, unexpected onset of a health condition that requires immediate medical treatment and/or an operation. If the treatment is not available, the emergency could result in weakened bodily functions, serious and lasting damage to organs, limbs or other body parts, or even death .In an emergency, it is not always possible to diagnose the condition before admitting the patient for treatment. However, if doctors diagnose patients with conditions that are covered by PMBs, schemes are obliged to approve treatment. Your medical scheme may request that the diagnosis be confirmed with supporting evidence within a reasonable period of time.Members who are treated in a casualty unit and not admitted into hospital, are usually covered from their day-to-day benefits, because the condition is not considered a medical emergency. For such non-emergencies a co-payment may apply, depending on your individual shemes rules, for non-network and non-authorised hospital admissions.Examples An example of a true medical emergency in the setting of a road accident would be a Flail chest. Flail chest is a life-threatening medical condition that occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks under extreme stress and becomes detached from the rest of the chest wall.On the other hand, a minor whiplash injury; uncomplicated fractures; minor skin wounds requiring stitches; a minor head injury; bruises and abrasions would not qualify as medical emergencies.According to Bonitas 2015 statistics, the most injuries claimed for as emergencies were due to fractures (broken bones), head injuries, open wounds and burns.Additional information the hospital might need to knowIn an emergency it is a good idea to provide the hospital with as much information as possible to make the best decision about your treatment.Specific allergies, blood type, religious impacts on treatment, living wills and special medical devices such as pacemakers can easily be documented with electronic devices but also make sure your family members have all this information on hand.AbroadWhen you plan to travel in a foreign country you should contact your scheme beforehand to determine the amount of cover you have. Most schemes have international travel benefits, but is not necessarily part of your benefit option and should be taken out as separate cover.Side box: Important&nbsp;This article was sponsored by Bonitas Medical Aid
