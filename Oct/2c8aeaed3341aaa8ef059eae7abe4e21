A Moneyweb reader sent in the following question:I intend on retiring in March 2017. I would like your opinion on the following:My questions are as follows: Answer:As the reader has not specified his age, I have assumed that he and his spouse are over 65 but under 75. The tax is slightly higher for individuals under the age of 65 so if he is under 65 I am happy to deal with him directly. I have tried to maximise the reader s tax exemptions in my advice below. I have assumed inflation to be 6%.A simple calculation on whether he has enough capital is the following:After-tax income of R24 000 per month or R288 000 per annum equates to a pre-tax income of R345 000 (PAYE = R56 323, leaving the client with a net R24 056.42 per month as an income). Therefore R345 000 / his capital of R3 300 000 + R500 000 + R3 250 000 = 0.049. Expressed as a percentage, this client needs to draw 4.9% from his income to produce that income.Given the market conditions and his need to increase that income draw by 6% per annum, the short answer is he does not have enough capital currently to retire on that income with an inflationary increase of 6%. We are able to maximise his and his wife s tax deductions to decrease his draw down on his income and thereby try and grow his capital by 4% per annum, so that he is able to increase his income annually &#8211; however not by 6%, closer to 4%.On the R3.3 million compulsory money invested into a range of risk-profiled, multi-asset portfolios targeting inflation +3%, the client is able to take a 4% draw without affecting his capital, and over time growing his capital by 2% to 4% per annum. There is an awesome unlisted property portfolio, that on an untaxed basis has delivered 10% returns consistently for the last 35 years on the compulsory side. Four percent as an income is R132 000 per annum, giving the client an after-tax income from his compulsory annuity of R10 762.25 per month ie R11 000 to R237.75, PAYE = R10 762.25.On his R500 000 discretionary emergency savings, I would recommend that he donates R150 000 to his spouse so that they both utiliSe their interest exemption of R34 500 per annum for individuals over the age of 65. I have seen money market rates of 8% this week. Eight percent on the full R500 000 gives the reader R28 000 tax-free income in his hands and a further R12 000 tax-free income in his wife s hands. This is an additional R3 333.33 per month added to their R10 762.25, giving them R14 095.58 after-tax income.On the client s other R3 250 000 discretionary money, he could again donate the funds into his wife s name so that she could draw 4% from the discretionary funds and in her name her after-tax income would be R10 833.33 R237.75 PAYE = R10 595.58.This added to the R10 762.25 from the compulsory annuity, and the R3 333.33 interest income, would give the client and his spouse a total after-tax income of R24 691.16 per month.The discretionary investment of R3 250 000 will incur tax within the portfolio, so will need to be invested slightly more aggressively than the R3.3 million compulsory money in the living annuity in which there is no tax incurred in the portfolio. A 4% draw is low enough to grow their capital over time. However not low enough to have a 6% increase on that income year after year. For the client to keep up with inflation he would need to have an after-fee return of 10% on the compulsory R3.3 million and an after-tax, after-fee return of 10% on the discretionary money. Given fees of 1.5% to 2% and tax of up to 2%, we need a gross return of 12% to14% to increase his income every year by 6%.To eliminate the tax on the discretionary money, the client could take advantage of section 10C and again donate the R3 250 000 to his spouse to put it in a single premium retirement annuity. Retire the funds and take her R500 000 tax-free lump sum from the one third to invest voluntarily, the other R572 500 will also be tax free as she has not been able to deduct her retirement annuity contribution against her tax in that tax year so R572 500 will be added to her tax free lump sum portion. Invest the other R2 177 500 into a compulsory living annuity as the portfolio s therein are not taxed the performance would not have to be as high to reach their net goal of 8% to 9% return. As she would not have been able to deduct her full RA contribution prior to retirement, the income drawn from the R2 177 500 annuity will be tax free as well until her full contribution has been deducted against both the lump sum and annuity income portion. Her R1million discretionary income can be invested in a capital bond guaranteeing an income of 7% for five years as well as the capital guaranteed at the end of the five-year term.Because we are taking a 7% draw from the discretionary money which is tax free, the draw from the R2 177 500 linked life annuity can be 2.5% and it can be moderately aggressively invested. Targeting inflation +4% over the next five years means we can grow the lump sum aggressively.Income from the guaranteed capital bond = R5 833.33 per month tax free (as from capital source).Income from the linked life annuity @2.5% draw = R4 536.45 per month (tax free re : section 10c). Giving the spouse R10 369.78 per month to add to the R14 095.58 after tax income of the client / reader, giving them the R24 000 they are needing monthly.The spouses annuity assuming an 8% after fee return will mean we are growing her living annuity by 5.5% per annum, so that at the end of the five-year term when the capital bond has matured, the R1 000 000 guaranteed return added to the R2 697 540.67 (ie R2,1million +5,5% compounded) will give her a capital amount of R3 697 540.67. At the end of the five-year term they can decide if they want to repeat the exercise depending on the guaranteed capital bond rates or if they would like to draw 4% from her capital for her income.
