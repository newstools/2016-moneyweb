Pick n Pay Stores shares rose the most in two weeks after the South African supermarket chain said first-half earnings gained as much as 25% and that pressures facing consumers in the country may “begin to alleviate” in the coming months. The stock increased as much as 3.3%, the most since September 22, and traded 0.97% higher at R68.64 at the close in Johannesburg. That extended an advance for the year of 6.6%, valuing the Cape Town-based company at R34 billion ($2.4 billion). South African shoppers have been battling a range of challenges to their disposable income, including unemployment of 27%, the slowest economic growth since 2009 and rising interest rates. Inflation, which held steady at 5.7% in September, is the most likely factor expected to ease, Pick n Pay said. Pick n Pay earnings per share excluding one-time items rose 20% to 25% in the 26 weeks ending August 28 to as much as R8.33, the company said in a statement on Friday. Sales increased by 7.2%. The retailer will release full half-year earnings on October 18. Shares in Shoprite Holdings, Africa’s largest food retailer, rose 1.60%, while Woolworths Holdings gained 0.56% to R77.81. © 2016 Bloomberg
