Goldman Sachs Group downgraded Tesla Motors shares, ditching a buy rating it placed on the stock in May as the investment bank co-managed a $1.4 billion share offering for the electric-car maker. Goldman analyst David Tamberrino downgraded Tesla to “neutral” from a “buy” in a note on Thursday, saying that the proposed merger with SolarCity Corporation makes Tesla a riskier bet. The bank lowered its 12-month target to $185 from $240, helping send Tesla shares down 2.8% to $202.60 in pre-market trading. “We now see incremental risk to the business related to management’s willingness to deploy capital for M&A, and we believe that any delay in the company’s timeline to launch its new Model 3 will be detrimental to the shares,” Tamberrino wrote in the report. Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk has said that the company will need to raise more cash and plans to do so in the fourth quarter or early next year. Goldman analyst Patrick Archambault upgraded Tesla on May 18 — the same morning that Tesla launched its secondary stock offering. Goldman and Morgan Stanley were lead managers on the deal, and Goldman said at the time that the call was made independently of the underwriting team. Separately, Goldman’s fund managers were dumping Tesla shares during the second quarter. The New York-based bank cut its ownership in half to 1.4 million shares in the period ended June 30, regulatory filings show. Goldman remains one of Tesla’s 20 largest holders, with just under 1% of the stock. Goldman spokeswoman Leslie Shribman declined to immediately comment. She said in May that said the bank followed all standards and policies with respect to the separation between research and sales. © 2016 Bloomberg
