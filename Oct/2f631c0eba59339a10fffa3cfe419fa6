CAPE TOWN â€“ At its last results announcement for the year ended 31 March 2016, Richemont declared a dividend of 1.7 Swiss francs per share. Holders of South African depository receipts (DRs) listed on the JSE, will receive one tenth of this, or 0.17 Swiss francs per DR. This dividend was paid to DR holders last month; however, it would have been subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax. As South African tax payers are only subject to a 15% dividend withholding tax, DR holders are entitled to reclaim 20% of the 35% that was withheld by Richemont in Switzerland. Richemont announced on Tuesday that the letters allowing DR holders to reclaim this amount will be emailed during the course of this month. Any DR holders who do not receive this letter should contact Computershare to ensure that they are not prejudiced.
