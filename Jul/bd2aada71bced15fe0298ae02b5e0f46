TUMISANG NDLOVU: For the next seven weeks here on MoneyTalk with Moneyweb on Radio 2000 we ll be chatting about online shopping, e-commerce. Shoppers can get great deals and enjoy the variety that the global e-commerce market offers. Companies big and small can grow their business by tapping into markets outside of South Africa, punch above their weight, of course. Guiding us on this journey is Efi Dahan, PayPal s general manager for Africa and Israel. Efi, take us through this campaign.EFI DAHAN: Thank you very much, let me say a few words about PayPal. PayPal was founded in 1998 and a couple of years after we were acquired by eBay, since last year we are an independent company listed on NASDAQ. So what is PayPal? PayPal is a digital wallet very similar to a wallet that we are familiar with but it s a virtual wallet, in the wallet you need to have money in order to use that. So regardless if you are a merchant or consumer you just need to open a PayPal account and link any payment method like credit card and start doing online shopping. As a merchant you can get paid into this wallet in 26 different currencies, we hold the currencies and then you can withdraw the money into your bank account.TUMISANG NDLOVU: Great stuff. Are South Africans shopping online?EFI DAHAN: Yes, South Africans are shopping online and I ll be happy to share a few numbers with the audience. Based on the research we conducted a couple of months ago by Ipsos, one of the leading research companies, 57% of South Africa online users age 18 and above already shopped online during the last 12 months, which is a lot, more than 50%. The total spend by South Africans is expected to be R37 billion this year and this is 30% up compared to last year and we will continue to see the same growth next year and we will hopefully reach R46 billion, R47 billion total spend by South Africans. So in sub-Saharan Africa PayPal has more than 600 000 active accounts.TUMISANG NDLOVU: Interesting.EFI DAHAN: So people engage PayPal and they love the benefits of shopping with PayPal.TUMISANG NDLOVU: So how does one get started?EFI DAHAN: Basically it s very simple, you go to www.paypal.com and in a few seconds or minutes you will have a PayPal account.TUMISANG NDLOVU: Wonderful.EFI DAHAN: You can select whether you want to be a buyer or a merchant, the process is very similar with some different things, and then you need to verify your account. You need to verify two things, first your email address, and the process is very simple and the website will take you through the process. The other thing we need to verify is the your credit card that you link to your PayPal account. Once you have it you can buy from more than 14 million merchants across 100 countries and more. Also as a merchant you can start selling to 184 million active accounts in more than 200 markets. It s very simple, you don t need to pay for the registration, you don t need to pay a monthly fee, just start using PayPal and enjoy the experience from the beginning.TUMISANG NDLOVU: PayPal has a relationship with FNB, does one need a bank account with FNB?EFI DAHAN: Not at all, any South African person can open a PayPal account and link a credit card issued by any bank in South Africa and can start doing online shopping. Also, any merchant can get paid with PayPal and withdraw the money to any bank in South Africa via the FNB online portal. So you can keep your money at any bank you want, you can use any cheque or credit card in South Africa, regardless if you are an FNB customer or not.TUMISANG NDLOVU: Great. Lastly, do you have to withdraw your earnings into South African rands?EFI DAHAN: That s a very good question, the default service is and this is how PayPal works in any market you can get paid, as I explained, in 26 different currencies and when you withdraw the money from your local bank we always convert it to the local bank. The idea is that you need the money in the local currency in order to pay. However, thanks to the cooperation with FNB if you have a foreign account in US dollars, an FNB bank account, you can withdraw the US dollars, you don t need to convert. This is a great advantage for a lot of merchants who need to pay in US dollars, they can avoid the conversion.TUMISANG NDLOVU: It makes a lot of sense. There you have it, plenty of opportunities for shoppers and merchants, especially entrepreneurs and small companies. Next week we ll look at how the world has gotten smaller and we are all shopping in similar ways. Global trends and South Africa are not different and the opportunities are global. Thank you for your time, PayPal general manager for Africa and Israel, Efi Dahan, here on MoneyTalk with Moneyweb on Radio 2000.
